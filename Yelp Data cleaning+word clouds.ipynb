The line kept been cutting in by the so-called diamond,platinum vip people.... we paid $80 per person and the service we got was not even a silver level. Horrible place to eat, not worth the best buffet in LV at all! Don't eat by two people, go with a group at least the line will be faster.\",\n",

They had these little egg dishes which were gross!! \\nDeserts were ok but I'm not looking for Creme Brûlée at 9:00am\\nWill save the $32 and go to ihop next time!!\",\n",

I was offered a towel to wash my feet in the sink and asked to fill out incident reports with security. After calming complaining to a manger 30 min later I was offered a coupon to come back again!!!\\n\\nFood was above average for a buffet. But we just spent $100 for a brunch I didn\\'t finish and was sent off insulted and angry. \\n\\nA restaurant in Caesars Palace should\\'ve been able to do more than say \"I\\'m sorry, we cleaned up the bathroom quickly. And here\\'s a coupon.\"',\n",

The food was sitting out, too long. Service took forever to get a drink. Lots of variety but not the quality I would expect. Especially the meat, they had no steak like advertised and the meat looked like it was sitting out too long. And don't get me started on the crab legs. They were very small. For the price I am not sure its worth the time or effort. Probably would stay away.\",\n",

(Okay I'm joking). But seriously some COOKED seafood would have been awesome. Up here near canada we cook our fish before we eat it and it tastes good that way too. Yep i don't mind sushi, but seriously.. Dessert bar was awesome and over the top maybe? All in all i left with a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended) and had to wash it down with another $9 margarita from a street vendor.\",\n",

Hyped it up to my girl so much. Was supposed to be the highlight of our 4 day vegas trip we made for food during the off season when vegas isn\\'t packed. Actually ended up being the worst day of the trip. \\nI read that diamond members complaint from a day or two ago on yelp and was hoping he was just a rich ass but no. Spent my hard earned money waited in line like the regular people and was SEVERLY let down. SAVE your MONEY. So much better food for FAR less money. Girlfriend got full on food poisoning to top it off. puking since midnight. This is a 4am post. I\\'m pissed and this is going to be a long one.\\nProbably from the cheap sushi they put out. Only thing she ate i didnt. I\\'ll start my more detailed food reviews below.\\n\\nFirst off you better know your foods very well because the labels are practically either non existent or in the wrong place. \\n\\nCarving station/ expensive proteins-\\nBeef ribs super salty and dry. Same with the supposedly holiday special suckling roast pig which was cold i thought the skin was supposed to be crispy? Prime rib bland and still chewy even though I got a medium rare piece. Beef brisket took 1 bite had to spit it out. Couldn\\'t chew it. Only thing at carving station worth eating was the lamb chops. Which actually was good. Would have went back for seconds if it wasn\\'t emptied out everytime I tried to get in line. \\n\\nSeafood- always an annoying line. Crab cakes only thing thats good there. Don\\'t know what people find so appealing about cold crab. They have them steamed also but honestly tastes like they take the cold crab from night before and just heat it up. Super salty. \\n\\nSince  all the \"high ends\" you pay for was a huge let down I started on the more carb heavy stuff really early. You would think they would get right to fill people up right? Wrong.\\nSliders were overcooked to oblivion and COLD. Apparently their heat lamps were broken today? Cuz we got a lot of cold food. Dim sum was eh. Had better tasting frozen dumplings.  Tried to get Ramen at 730 got \"broth is not ready yet\" .... really? It\\'s peak dinner time wtf... ok. Resort to desserts super early which is pretty hard to go wrong so that at least was a plus. Strawberry mousse thing was amazing i would try to say what it was only if they had anything labeled properly. Ran out of strawberry Gelato at 8pm. I got like the last scraps out of the tin.If they had more they didn\\'t offer me a fresh batch which is even worse. I mean desserts were desserts I usually don\\'t even get there in buffets since I just fill up on protein but yea....ended up stuffing myself with 1 bite of almost every dessert they had to quail my misery. Most were pretty good but was expecting to be blown away with all the hype so yea. Epic fail. I could probably keep going but suns almost up. I fell for the hype train but if your on your way and happen to read through this. Jump off the train!!!! \\n\\nSome recommendations to try to save some people. \\nIf you need to buffet. We tried wynn buffet on our trip last year which imo was wayyy better. But I doubt we will be doing any more vegas buffets unless its a 2 for 1. the option of variety is nice but just isn\\'t worth it if not even bacchanal can get the quality part down wit the absurd costs. Just try to pick what you want and go get the best.\\n\\nHighlights of the trip-  \\nthose guys pies off the strip, amazing cheesesteak, pizza not the best I\\'ve had but pretty up there and I can pretty much guarantee it\\'s better than bacchanals.\\nBruxie if u love fried chicken And waffles. Nashville hot was so good went there twice. \\nGordon ramsay fish and chips. Great moist fish nice light crispy batter. Dirty fries with chorizo was great also. \\n\\nI hope this review saves some people some $$$ and from severe disappointment.',\n",
       " 'So I come here on my birthday thinking it\\'s the best Buffet in town. (A little pricey for me  )but it\\'s NOT! Well the food was good. The false advertisement took me by surprise. I called the Buffet around 6 pm to make sure they had snow, king and stone crab and the Buffet said they sure did. For $50 per person I thought that was great. So decided to try. Side note I\\'ve been going to the Bellagio Buffet for $29 mon - thurs & get a king and snow crab. They have it complete separated. Ok now back to Bacchanal Buffet. I ask the chef at the crab station where the stone crab was and he looked at me like I was crazy. He said we don\\'t have stone crab and the king crab is mixed with the snow crab. It was like looking for a needle in a hay stack. Started out disappointed. Talked to the front person seating guests and they apologized for not having stone and assured me they have not had it or ever had it and that king was not really available. They said \"Michelle\" the manager on duty would come over to my table and explain. Well \"Michelle\" never came. The front lady came again to my table & apologized for Michelle not coming and said would have the main dinning restaurant serve me some king crab. So they did. And it was good. But the quality of the king crab was no where near as large or tasteful as the Bellagio Buffet for less money. I\\'m not coming back here for this price.., rather go elsewhere!',\n",
       " 'What a money pit! Food was terrible and not labeled!',\n",
       " \"Went here on Memorial Day weekend, and like other reviews, it was terrible.  We paid $55 for lunch, and the only thing that was any good was the brisket.  Everything else tasted like leftovers, or maybe it was just sitting out far too long.\\n\\nWe also wanted to get unlimited mimosas, but apparently, this buffet doesn't offer unlimited mimosas on holiday weekends.\\n\\nTip: Go to Wicked Spoon instead.\",\n",
       " \"I tried the Brunch at Bacchanal Buffet for $40 per person.  After all, it was not worthy my $40 and was quite disappointed.  There was no line when getting into the buffet.  I was expecting a long wait because the previous reviews online.  \\n\\nI understand that Brunch was the combination of breakfast and lunch.  Of course I found a lot of breakfast related foods.  Such as potato, eggs and bacon.  I just remember seeing a lot of potato plates.  I supposed to be a fan of potato but it was just way too much.  \\n\\nThe only thing I could remember that was good was the Chinese chicken ginseng soup that comes in a little pot container.  The soup was pretty good that I have to compliment and in a little cute pot.  \\n\\nFor the Japanese section, I was hoping to see some nice sushi selections.  Too bad, they only had some rolls that were not looking good.  They have small slices of sashimi combination in a little bowl but wasn't great at all. \\n\\nAfter all the disappointment, we waited until 3pm to see if they have more stuff for the dinner time.  I tried their little pearl oysters which I think were pretty fresh so we ate about 20 pieces.  We tried the lobster soup but wasn't that good. \\n\\nSo overall the experience wasn't that great for me and for $40 it wasn't worthy at all.  I could have pay less for the Bellagio buffet that has much more items.  And remember, the dinner price was about $48.\",\n",
       " 'We saw all the hype about this new buffet being built. Bottom line not as great as we expected. They stopped serving snow crabs due to complaints. We walked by during lunch asked a women what time dinner started 3pm and I specifically asked will you guys be serving King crab? Yes. We get inside at 5pm beat the lines and guess what?? No snow crab no king crab. The cooks said they only serve king crab on the holidays? You kidding me? Food presentation wise I would rate a 1star. Compared to Wicked Spoon and Bellagio they have great presentation on there food and it has great flavors!! Bellagio serves king crab every night for dinner! We were so disappointed. Try Wicked Spoon at Cosmo there food is delicious and beautifully put together!!! Bellagio buffet has great selections and all you can eat king crab for dinner. Oh and the other thing that bothered me is at the front they display all sorts of seafood fish, crab, and lobster. Most of what they have on display is not even served on there buffet very deceiving!',\n",

At 6:10pm, we return to check on the status. We were told that we could line up to pay before they sit us. I saw a very long line, so I checked with the host three times that it was the correct time. All of them said yet, so I asked what the purpose is for the ticketing system. It implied that using the ticketing system should help us avoid the long wait. So far we have waited 1 hour already and there are at least 100 ppl in front of us. So, don't believe their STUPID ticketing system. No matter what, you got to wait for about 4 hours.\",\n",

As always an extreme wait and they over pack it with people but despite the high volumes of people much of the food tasted stale and like it had been sitting a long time. There was a huge wait the entire time for the boiled crabs.  The cold crabs were not even whole legs they were just small pieces and they gave you nothing to peel it open with.   Service was spotty and the place is starting to look dingy.  Even the desserts were meh the only thing I liked was the Gelato and the creme brûlée.  Next time we'll go elsewhere especially since this was $59 with tax.\",\n",

Disappointments: takes a while to get a waiter to order a drink, especially your second drink. The dessert station is also subpar. You'll find more and better choices at the Wynn or Aria buffets.\\n\\nBachanal is the most hyped (and highly priced) buffet on the strip, but decidedly not the best one.

Under those circumstances, bring a drink in from Fat Tuesday's (they let a large group do that!).\\n\\nThe food overall is very diverse, but nothing really stood out except maybe the bread and the waffles. When sliced bread is what stands out at a buffet, that's when you know they've done something wrong. The prime rib was disappointingly raw and chewy, the brisket was ridiculously fatty, and the sausage was not amazing. \\n\\nSome famous items like the chocolate strawberries and mochi were not there during Memorial Weekend, I wonder if my experience wasn't as good because of the special menu?\",\n",

We looked forward to fresh oysters, small plate gourmet dishes, macarons, sashimi, unique sauces and spreads.  We returned today with high expectations, and gladly paid the $59.99 per adult cost for a highly advertised special July 4th brunch.  \\n\\nI will never go again, and I urge you to save your money.   The crab legs were stale and small.  The roast beef was overly salty and tough.  The chicken and waffles were dry and flavorless.  The raw handrolls were fishy and anemic.  The lobster ravioli tasted somewhere between rubber and hard plastic.   The steamed xlb were sweet...why?  The hamachi kama were deep fried, dry and salty... how could they ruin such a great ingredient.  The majority of foods were starchy and a waste of time and stomach space.  \\n\\nAs we left we complained to the manager because we didn't see half of the menu options that they had advertised.  They shooed us out quickly, with a promise to charge us $10 less for the 4 adults.  \\n\\nI think people who love this place are misled by the presumptuous namesake of this place, with a high sticker price to convince themselves that it was good.  I was certainly fooled.\",\n",
       " \"This buffet can be summarized in 3 words: QUANTITY OVER QUALITY. \\n\\nThere are hundreds of choices at this buffet, probably the buffet with the largest selection in the world, but majority tastes average if not terrible. Nothing special other than selection. \\n\\nLet's start with the seafood. The crab legs and claws were so so so salty and didn't taste very fresh. The texture wasn't that great either. Maybe they were frozen for too long? The oysters weren't salty but also not very fresh. Shrimps were average, like every other restaurant/buffet, much like the ones in shrimp cocktails. \\n\\nAll the other common items like pasta, prime rib, pizza, and burgers were average. Wasn't expecting much either. \\n\\nDesserts. I expected much better. There was lots of selection for ice cream flavours, but all of them tasted very artificial. DO NOT TRY THE LEMON BASIL FLAVOUR. I thought it would just taste like lemon with a hint of basil but the basil is very very strong.\\n\\nThere are 4 colours of macarons BUT THEY ALL TASTE THE SAME. No flavour at all, only sugar taste. \\n\\nThe crepe itself wasn't bad, but there are no options for fillings, only sauces. Maybe some fruit?\\n\\nThis is definitely a one time thing for me. I prefer quality over quantity. The money spent could be put to much better use.\",\n",

She spoke to us slowly and like children, as if she expected my Korean American husband to speak back with a heavy FOB accent.  We complained to the manager about the mistreatment and lack of professionalism and the manager was disinterested in what we had to say and blandly offered to bring over a glass of champagne.  Champagne?  The experience wasn\\'t worth celebrating.  \\n\\nOnce we settled down and sat at the table for several minutes deciding if we wanted to stay, we thought getting a refund would cause more hassle so we decided to just hit the buffet and try to put the terrible service behind us.  The buffet was long and large and plentiful.  Stick with the main buffet area and don\\'t bother going to the side room which is stocked with high carb cheaper fair like Chinese food, bread, pasta and salad.  The main area has about six types of juice rotating at once as well as variations of maybe ten types of meats as well as fish and stone crab claws.  The dessert bar was pretty and plentiful.  There were crepes on command and unique gelato flavors.\\n\\nWhile the buffet was pretty huge and we left with full stomachs, I don\\'t know that we need to return.  There are just too many ostentatious buffets in Vegas and certainly we can find one that balances food, flair and good service.',\n",
       " 'Sigh, as a foodie, I have never felt this disappointed before. As if I took a huge gulp from a cup of regret. This place had nothing that all these comments and photos promised. \\n\\nNothing. No honeycomb, no lobster (well, for extra charge), no beautiful steaks.\\n\\nMy wife and I experience much similar food in most buffets in Los Angeles. For example: Zen buffet, Kirin Buffet etc. \\n\\nTheir sushi: the cuts of fish they had were random, no discipline or technique or skill in their knife work was shown. \\nTheir crab legs: Over boiled and have lost the signature umami and moisture in this awesome ingredient.\\nTheir oysters: fresh, but washed and therefore flavorless.\\nTheir frog legs: obviously frozen and deep fried to hide the fact.\\n\\nTheir Chinese food section, however, is good. \\nThe whole roasted pigs were crispy and well seasoned. The roasted ducks were also delicious and authentic, although a little too salty. Their steamed section is very well handled. \\n\\nThe only reason why I am giving an extra star to this place is that the service is excellent! The place looks great and feels great.\\n\\nAll in all, please do not waste 90 minutes and $60 per person on this place. The Bacchanal is definitely not a worthy feast for the Gods.',\n",
       " 'I usually don\\'t post on yelp, unless the experience is really good or really bad.  Well, this one is terrible.  It\\'s the morning of Sunday Jan 17th, and as I went down to the buffet to check the line length and to ask whether the reservation machine was on, all I got was this \"you aren\\'t good enough for this place\" attitude from an old white lady working the line.  It\\'s ironic that my whole stay is being comped by the casino.  The attitude turned me off so much that I probably won\\'t ever go near the buffet again, and would think twice about taking the comp from Caesars.  I would understand if she was busy and overworked, but in her own words, the line was only 30 mins long.  I would expect better from an establishment like Caesars.',\n",
       " 'Super disappointed in this whole experience.\\nFirstly, at about 4pm on the Friday before Memorial Day my husband and I called to find out the prices, and we were told $50 for dinner.  We got dressed and arrived around 5pm, only to find out that prices were actually $62/person.  We had just called about this information!!!  They would not honor the price we were quoted, but offered champagne, which we declined because we were driving (not gonna lie, I was a little irritated they wanted to make us another couple of drunks on Memorial Day weekend).  So we left that night without eating.\\nWe returned today around 2:15 and hopped in line.  Although the line was almost all the way full, there was only ONE CASHIER letting people in.  Of course we are second in line to pay at 2:55, when they stop the line claiming the restaurant was too full and they could no longer let anyone else in.  Several groups behind us in line left.  At 3:05 they magically are able to open back up and we of course have to now pay the dinner price, despite the fact we were there waaaay before 3pm.  SUPER ANNOYING, and that on top of my raging hunger got the poor cashier a tongue lashing.  Not her fault, but a pretty shitty way to run a business, especially when we pass SIX empty tables on the way to our own and notice almost an entire section of tables empty; there was no way it was \"too full\" ten minutes earlier.  Thanks for ensuring we won\\'t return, Caesar\\'s.\\nAnyway, on to the food.  Nothing impressive, I much prefer the buffet at Wynn.  The sushi was excellent for buffet sushi, there was a great bread selection, and a huge offering of desserts.  The overall selection is amazing, like fried pickles and edamame and like ten different kinds of salsa, but the quality is only average.  The pasta dishes had been sitting out to where the cheese had hardened, and the chef said he couldn\\'t place more out until those were taken.  The line for the seafood stuff was ridiculously long, it went all the way into the American foods station. The dessert spread is massive, and I have a huge sweet teeth so I sampled everything I could fit inside of me!  The cookies and mini cupcakes (love that they are mini!) were divine, everything else was just meh.  The tiramisu, normally my fave, was awful!  Hubby isn\\'t much a dessert fan but occasionally partakes and didn\\'t like anything he tried.   Service was mediocre.  We had our dishes pile up a bit, but a glass never went dry and that was great. Overall, I would skip this buffet and use the money at a better restaurant elsewhere.  If you\\'re set on a buffet, try the Wynn!',\n",
       " \"I remember this buffet was way better the last few time I was here but now is not that great. Especially the service was really BAD. The server ask and serve everyone around us but never ask us how we are doing or if I needed more drink. I will never come back again. I did not pay $119 plus dollars to get bad service. I gave it a one star because the tacos was pretty good. DON'T waste your $$$.\",\n",
       " \"It was ok IMO. I read great reviews on here and was really excited to try this place but I was underwhelmed. I tried a number of different dishes and thought the best parts of the buffet were the cooked salmon in the seafood bar, the wagyu beef, French fries and the desserts. The shrimp was ok but the crab legs were disappointing. At the time I went there were only skinny crab legs and they were really salty. I found other dishes were too salty too IMO including the shrimp dumplings. The Lomein was ok but the duck wings in the Asian food section had no taste really. The pork ribs were decent but the mashed potatoes were far too creamy - not enough potatoes. The elk burger was good. The highlight of the buffet really was the dessert section but the desserts were quick to go and staff didn't put more out fast enough so I didn't unfortunately get to try all the ones I wanted to. \\n\\nI would not pay 39 a person again for this buffet and I did not think it was worth the thirty minute wait. Of course buffets are supposed to be the thing you do when in Vegas so this was for the experience only. I would have rather visited a good restaurant. \\n\\nA couple of other things to point out - the line for 1-2 parties was far slower than larger parties so that was annoying. Also our waitress thought we were done 3/4 of the way through our meal likely because we had desserts then. So when we got back to our table all of our dishes and drinks etc were gone. The next waitress apologized but still. \\n\\nThe food gets 2.5 stars. The service gets 3. I don't know how others gave this place more than two stars for food based on my experience and next time I check a new place out I will be sure to check the negative reviews more carefully!\",\n",
       " \"What a let down. I paid 54.99 (not including tax or tip) for a weeknight dinner buffet. The only thing that was decent was the crab legs. Everything else was just mediocre. There wasn't even a big variety of food. I was looking forward to the dessert bar but everything I tasted was bleh. So very disappointing. I much prefer the dessert bar at the rio world carnival. I recommend saving your money and gambling it away or else treat yourself to a good steak at a decent restaurant.\",\n",
       " \"Underwhelming, went for dinner and it seemed they were out of a lot of items. A lot of the items were not labeled and the employees were not very helpful when I asked what the items were. They could have fixed the labels if they didn't want people asking. Over hyped and overpriced. Food was good and of good quality for the most part, but no item really stood out. They tried to squeeze our large party onto one table, but fortunately a table nearby was just finishing so they split our group into two. Service was good though.\",\n",
       " \"I have to admit after reading all the wonderful Yelp reviews I was looking forward to eating here.  Unfortunately, I was not impressed.  The food was just so-so.  The prime rib was more fat than meat,  I was surprised that the carver didnt carve any of the fat off.  I'm not talking about a little fat.  There was a lot.  Everything else was just o.k.  My desserts were terrible.  I had one kind of like a mexican waffle cake ( can't remember the name) and it was hard as a rock.  Plus the plates at the dessert station were all hot.  I would have thought those would be chilled.  The service was good and the hostess who sat us was wonderful.  Our dinners were comped thank heavens because there is no way it was worth 55$ and to be truthful I wouldn't eat there again even if they offered me another comp.\",\n",

Came back after 80 minutes and their employee said it would be 30-45 min in line. We waited in line for two hours. When we were closer to the front they said it would be another hour.  We then left and went to a normal restaurant. We've eaten here several times before. It is not worth waiting in line for. We will never be back to eat or gamble. It is not an upscale casino.\",\n",

       " \"I would say that this place is impressive but then I'd be lying, the servers and hosts were very rude, we made reservations for 11:45 am and were told when we arrived that they don't take reservations and then we were  told they do, then they told us you we would be texted when your tables were ready, an hour  and a half go by,  and still no text, so then we go up and ask what's going on and we are told that we cannot sit together and that if we wanted tables together it was going to be an 18 % gratuity in addition to  the already 600$ bill for breakfast, being that we were a party of 11 that would normally make sense but being that this is a BUFFET,  we were not having it, when a manager finally came she was rude and unapologetic, and seemed to roll her eyes and just generally was very unprofessional, she told us basically she can't do anything, then rudely said I will get the general manager and he can explain it to you the same way I did and maybe you'll understand. Another  thing the subordinate manager said later on that was rude was when she had us being taken to our seats  she told the host to make sure she split us up,even after all the hassle of simply letting us sit together , so the general manager comes out and before he did they were telling us that even if we split up into two groups we'd still be charged gratuity and the tables wouldn't be close, finally we get sat and and the general manager was able to take off the gratuity and we got two tables and they were semi close. The food was great until a few hours later when my stomach was unsettled and I threw my 600$ meal up. Long story short, I would never return there and strongly advise others against it as well, the only reason it gets 2 stars is because the food was decent, service is terrible and aside from the general manager, management was very unprofessional.\",\n",

The wait time to get seated, we were told, was 17-22 minutes.  We were instructed to come back when the system texted my phone and wait \"a few minutes\" for our table to get ready.  When we came back we had to wait in an enormous line to pay and then an obnoxiously long line to get seated.  After 45 minutes waiting to get seated (total wait time of one hour and 23 minutes now), we were finally able to sit down.  This was extremely nerve racking because we had show tickets and were seriously worried we would not make the show.  While we were in line they repeatedly pulled people from behind us in line to get seated.  Once seated our server came over and took our drink order.  She came back with our drinks and was never seen again.  We pretipped $40 and I wish we hadn\\'t left that.  \\nNow to the food: the crab legs were great.  Sushi was exceptional.  Mashed potatoes were phenomenal.  Macaroni and cheese was good.  Lamb was tasty.  Good choices for desserts.  However, there is such a thing as having too much.  There were so many choices that I almost felt cheated out of my money because there\\'s no way someone my size could get their money\\'s worth.  Which, by the way, is an astronomical amount.  $56 a person just to wait for almost an hour and a half for a table that we spent 30 minutes at?  No thank you.  \\nOverall: food is great.  Service is terrible.  And you\\'re lucky if you ever get seated.  Will not return ever again.  Save your time and go to the Wynn for a fabulous buffet.\\n\\nStill wish someone from Bacchanal had reached out to me about our horrible experience. I would be willing to give it another try.

Dishes are not in individual portions like they were in the past but like all low quality buffetts, dishes sit in large vats getting mushy and overcooked. This effect made the clams and mussels all dried and rubbery. Crab croquettes and crab fried rice no longer available.  All corn and no lobster in lobster chowder. Carne asada tacos chewy and not even close to par with King Taco.  Real gelato no longer served but instead sub with super sweet cheap ice cream with fake plastic props in display case.

That was the wait before we paid then there was another 20 minute wait after we paid.

This is the newer one out of the bunch, and judging by photos and reviews, it looked like we were in for a luxurious feast. Not your normal buffet!\\n\\nThe line was long and sweeping, and took approximately an hour to get to the front where you pay first. Memorial Day weekend we ended up paying brunch prices, not lunch, which was approximately $50. Okay, well, I heard about the steak...and the starters..and the seafood...has to be worth it! *If you tack on $20, you can go in the express line.\\n\\nUpon entry, it looked gorgeous.

The buffet here operates by lines; you can\\'t really cut in to just grab a certain dish, unless you are daring enough to brave the snarls of hungry line waiters. There were assorted Mexican rice dishes, then some salads, soups, bread rolls and cold pastas (which no one ventured into cause it curved inwards and people didn\\'t want to lose their spot in line) before hitting the Memorial Day sliders. The sliders and small items were placed on cute colored square dishes, which take up much real estate on your plate. I saw a man plop those items on his white plate (genius!) before he got reprimanded by the chef for not taking the square plate with him. But let\\'s be real--you have to wait so long to just get an item....people are not going to be going back in line because your plate sizes don\\'t make sense.\\n\\nOnto the food:\\n\\nPROTEIN: Cuts of meat included rib eye (best protein here), lamb shank (salty), brisket (salty), chicken (didn\\'t try) and a fatty bacon slice. The waffle fries were in cute mini fryer baskets, but unfortunately were overly salty. \\nPASTA: baked lasagna cube. Nasty, dry, heavy....nyuck.\\nSALAD: So-so. Again with the square plates!\\nSUSHI: too much rice. If you pick off the salmon off the nigiri, you can get some good sashimi bites, though.\\nUDON/RAMEN SOUP: Actually pretty decent. The broth was yummy and not too salty! Cooked fresh per order, and the line went super fast for this.\\nDESSERT: crepes were one of the highlights of Bachannal desserts. It\\'s DIY except for the fresh crepe. The lava cake was good, but overly heavy and dense. fresh, no yucky icicle ridden gelato here. They only give you 1 mini scoop which again, takes up valuable plate real estate if you get more than 1 flavor.\\nSEAFOOD: Shrimp was wonderful. crab legs were good, but mine were cold. You\\'ll have to wait for the fresh steamed one and work at it. No oysters until dinner service...sad.\\nSIDES: only liked the fresh vegetables, which was probably cooked in butter. The mac and cheese was dense. Salty fries. \\nDRINKS: peach green tea for the win.\\n\\nService was good--the people clearing plates were very, very fast and efficient. However, drinks were very slow. It\\'s too overpriced and too limited in good items that you can get at subpar restaurants.

We were told that we have to stand in line and wait for another 1 hour and 30 mins.  That is just ridiculous!  Of course we ended up eating at a different place.  I just hope that the line is not like this everyday. On a lighter note, there's this one lady who I think is a Diamond or a 7 Stars member who was going around the line of people and telling everyone that she can take anyone to the front of the line as long as they pay her cash LOL.

Once we were seated and I got my first plate of food I was so excited since I was thinking that my food was going to be succulent and scrumptious. NOPE. For some odd reason my hot food was room temperature at best and my cold food was warm when it was supposed to be cold. To make matters worse, our waiter left at the end of his shift and that was why we never got our refills on drinks. The best part of the meal was when I got the green fudge. The fudge was good.

I was getting so annoyed because the line was up to  the \"make your own\" taco section and the seafood was on the other end of it basically. It made me not want to get up and wait for more food because I didn\\'t wanna keep waiting in that line. I am sooo disappointed with this buffet. I really wanted to like it since I LOVED Wicked Spoon and this was proclaimed \"The Best Buffet in Vegas.\" I think they should re-analyze that and consider everything else. The buffet was so packed and the buffet itself was so dirty. Food on the floor, no serving spoons on some dishes which made other people use a spoon they weren\\'t supposed to which cross-contaminates the dish. The sushi is very low quality. The presentation of it is very mediocre. This was the first and only time I will ever eat here again. If you\\'re debating whether or not you want to go to Wicked Spoon or Bacchanal Buffet next time you\\'re in Vegas, I suggest going to Wicked Spoon instead. Going here is like a waiting game.

That is all acceptable considering huge amount of people visiting this city especially during holiday. The worst is our waitress. She never came here asking us if everything is good, and she never asked us if our drink needs to be refilled. I asked her where the restroom is and she was just murmuring and went away, never came back to me again. When she was taking away our platters, she just threw the folks and knives on the table like there is nobody eating beside, making very annoying noises.\\n\\nSecond, let's talk about food. Yes there are Chinese food, pizza, all kinds of meat, fruits and desserts, seafood. But choices of mixes of vegetables are really limited. Seafood is okay, but I believe similar restaurants elsewhere could also serve the same food while asking for less money and providing more pleasant service.\\n\\nI only give one star rating as this experience is far away from my imagination of Las Vegas buffet which I have dreamed of since I was a child. I hope the restaurant could improve its service quality and availability of more food combinations.

Instead there is only snow crab legs, and when I asked for King crab legs, I was told that the snow crab was better and the crab legs came in a mixed box, so I had to take what was out on the buffet.  Tell me why King crab sells for 3 times more on the outside if it is not as good as snow crab? Most of the food looked like it was out for quite awhile.

       " \"My husband and I just returned from a trip to Las Vegas.  Prior to leaving we had done a ton of research trying to figure out all the restaurants we wanted to hit and the Bacchanal Buffet quickly went to the top of the list.  We were both so excited to try out what had been identified as the best buffet in Vegas and we were unfortunately completely underwhelmed and disappointed.\\n\\nMy husband and I decided to hit up the Bacchanal Buffet on Easter, partly because of the menu they promoted as even more special than usual.  Although the buffet typically is said to have a lot of premium options, on Easter they were supposed to have even more.  This was totally a bait and switch tactic making us pay a higher premium price for the same items that are normally offered.  From everything we saw, the food was all the same as it typically was and multiple items that were listed on the special Easter menu were not even offered.\\n\\nAs an example, two things my husband and I were very excited about were the King Crab Legs and the Wagyu Sliders mentioned on the Easter menu.  There were no King Crab Legs anywhere in site.  Instead there were piles of snow crab legs offered.  Same goes for the Wagyu Sliders.  All my husband and I found were pork sliders, definitely not beef and definitely not Wagyu.  There were numerous other items that were missing as well - but these were definitely the two that we were the most disappointed in.\\n\\nIn addition to this, the food that was available wasn't very good at all and was definitely not worth the high price tag.  The seafood was bland and in some cases did not even seem fresh.  The soup station served me ramen soup that was so salty I couldn't eat more than one spoon.  The leg of lamb was so gamey it was inedible.  The asian dishes were basically the same thing you would get at a greasy panda express.  I could go on and on about the uninspired, cheap food that we had, but I will leave it at this - the Bacchanal Buffet was the equivalent of any other buffet type restaurant with a much higher price tag.\\n\\nCouple this with service that was mediocre at best and my husband and I felt completely ripped off.  For those who are planning on visiting Las Vegas, I recommend avoiding this buffet and instead visiting one of the tons of other amazing restaurants that are nearby!  My husband and I ended up spending over $150 just for the two buffets plus tip and I so wish we had spent that money somewhere else.  I honestly have no idea how so many individuals have rated this buffet so well.  I'll cross my fingers that our experience was rare, but I highly doubt it.\",\n",

       " \"Honestly, I'm not sure what the hype is with this place and I definitely cannot say it was worth the price. We came here as a group of 4 right at like 2:30- 2:45, just before lunch switches to dinner (they don't close for dinner). There's a 2 hour limit, like most of the buffets you'll come across and it's like clockwork, soon as you hit the hour-and-a-half mark, your server is nowhere to be found.\\n\\nAmbience, is nice and class. You can definitely dress up a little to this place, but why would you? You're going to a buffet! It's chow-down time and you need to stuff your face. We wore tees, shorts, and sandals to this place and received no awkward stares (or so we didn't notice because we came here for the food).\\n\\nHostess takes you to your table and your server shortly greets you while taking your drink orders. The table is nice and the chairs looked expensive. Seafood is towards the front entrance, it transitions to BBQ/ american, then a few options for soup, and a juice bar (like pre-made bottled juices). Further into the restaurant, there's a Mexican bar where you can order tacos. Around the corner there's the Italian food and the make your own charcuterie and cheese station. Further in the back there's a salad bar and tucked way in the back corner there's a limited selection of sushi rolls and some Chinese food.\\n\\nI think I was able to try nearly 75% of the food they offered. I skipped the bbq and grilled meats so I can't comment on that, and I also skipped the taco bar. Everything else though, was mehhhh. As for the seafood, the oysters on the half-shell come out for dinner and they looked and tasted as if they were shucked earlier in the morning. They were dry and drained of their liqueur. I was craving oysters and actually had to refrain from eating them. I saw some people with plates-full of oysters and I just cringed. The rock crab claws were probably one of the better seafood items. The ceviche was pretty good too, but I would skip the snow crab legs because they were just too briney, however, they did saw the legs in half lengthwise so it was easy to pick out the meat. Skip the crawfish boil (it was pretty bland). Soups were descent and the of the sweet potato fries were as good as sweet potato fries can be. The tacos were surprisingly good and the salsa bar which had guac was on point for a buffet. The guava juice and tamarind juice was refreshing. The raviolis were really good, but they only put one per ramakin so grab a whole bunch of ramakins! The meats and cheese were dried out when were there but the salad bar was pretty descent (nowhere near a sweet tomatoes or a soup plantation, but they had a descent selection of greens). Desserts were probably one of the highlights. Get gelato and red velvet cakes. The chocolate cookies were good too!\\n\\nEverything else was pretty meh. The server was attentive but disappeared once it approached the 2 hour point. Not worth the $60/person dinner since the dinner options didn't offer much of a difference from lunch. If you want to try both dinner and lunch, but pay for lunch price (~$40), I would just do what we accidentally did and show up around 2:30 pm. You can call ahead of time and see if there is a major line because soon as it turns 3:00pm, it's dinner and you'll be stuck with the $60/person price. This place is definitely not worth waiting in line for.\\n\\nIf you have money to throw away, sure why not? But if you're on a tight budget for food and would rather gamble away all your money, I would skip this and do the burger or slice of pizza somewhere else.\",\n",
       " \"This place is over rated.  The line to pay and get in is crazy long and when you get into the buffet there are more lines (especially the seafood section) to get your food.

All for $55, what a bargain? Not. Perhaps the only good thing about it was the dessert bar,  but never again would I go to this buffet.\",\n",

No sushi, no nothing. My last time going there.',\n",

Except when we came back at 7:18 PM, there was a ridiculously long line with a rude hostess. I asked her how long the wait is and she said 1 hour. 1 hour??? What in the world is the point of the virtual waitlist system then? I told her we had a show to attend at 9:30 PM and she said well that's your problem. Nice.

When we get there, Stephanie asks us to pay first before we get inside. WHAT?? Am I in the twilight zone??

The express line will grant you VIP entry and seating at Bacchanal.\" That was the zinger, right there. For those of us who don\\'t work in the industry, it sounds like she was offering us buffet passes. \"VIP entry and seating\" sounds like a buffet pass. Of course we realize that it was just a bait and switch, and they just wanted to make themselves look good on yelp, when in reality, they are condescending when they explain to you in person that \"the VIP line is a $25 value and it allows you to cut in line.\" Whoop dee doo.\\n\\nReally wish I could give Zero stars.

When we got there we had to wait again to pay. They let a few people every 5-10min it seems pay and wait to be seated. We then had to wait for another 45min to pay!

Overall, the buffet offered a good selection, but quality is lacking, especially the Chinese section which resembled food from a cheap take out place or food court food. Although most buffets have this issue and no one ever goes into a buffet expecting top quality, the price of this one was too much for what they offered. It was $95 Canadian.

They put all the Asian customers in the back of the restaurant where the Asian food area is. There are no Asians anywhere in the other parts of the restaurant nor is there any non asians in the Asian section.

The cake/pie/flan portion size is perfect for one so no leftover will be wasted. \\n\\nThe reason for 1 star off is because the meat section was a bit weak.

After weeks of anticipation, I finally tried it for dinner today. Talk about a huge disappointment! Maybe tonight was just an off night, but with the hefty price, I won't bother coming back anytime soon to see if today was just a fluke. \\n\\nFirst off, I knew of the high price, so that was no problem. I had no qualms about paying for what I expected to be an excellent dining experience. The line may not look too bad, but it moves very slowly. Then after you pay, there's another slow moving line to get seated. (If you're not in the Express line, or a Diamond/Platinum Total Rewards member, expect a long wait during peak times). For dinner, it took an hour and fifteen mins from entering the line to finally being seated. Ambiance and decor were nice inside, but it's all about the food right? (Also, a lot of the walkways between tables are narrow. Just an FYI in case you're larger sized, you may want to request being seated along the edges).\\n\\nService was pretty good, drinks refilled and server was very much on top of clearing plates away. It was one of the few highlights of the meal.\\n\\nAgain, maybe tonight was an off night, but everything I tried was so dry and tough or had little flavor. The lamb was not juicy at all, the brisket was so overcooked and dry to the point of being inedible. I took a bite and unfortunately had to leave it unfinished on my plate. Also tried halibut with herbs and fennel, but it was strangely completely flavorless. Tried the wagyu beef slider, but instead of being moist and juicy it was overcooked and dry. The first batch of Korean kalbi short ribs were actually decent, but my second helping was completely chewy and the marinade tasted different than the first time. Many items looked dry and unappetizing. It made it difficult to find items to fill up my plate. Was hoping to try lobster bisque, but only found lobster corn chowder that did not have any lobster to be found. It made up for it in the amount of corn though and was disgustingly sweet that I also had to leave unfinished. \\n\\nDessert...walked around the area to scope everything out first before diving in. Everything looked pretty but few items jumped out enough to make you want to eat them. Nothing terrible to say about the desserts, but nothing memorable at all either. \\n\\nVery disappointing. With the 500+ items this buffet touts, I was expecting more. The selection didn't seem anywhere near what this buffet claims. There's nothing worth noting at the buffet that I found to be mouth watering or worth going back for seconds. The Bacchanal Buffet does NOT deserve its current reputation as the best buffet in Las Vegas.\",\n",

That's not the bad part of the experience, the food was great but they were not the best. The only food that I really enjoyed here is their arugula pizza, shrimp dim sum, chicken and mushroom (Found in the Chinese food section), and their bottomless mimosas. The worst part for me is that I also had stomach pain from eating seafood salad from here...Is it worth $60+ per person for brunch (HELL NO). So much for the best buffet in town, I only enjoyed 3-4 items from out of how many selections lol.. I still think wicked spoon is better (cheaper and their brunch menu is more tastier).

Even most of the dim sum items, like the dumplings and jellyfish were extremely sub-par for any restaurant that would care to serve these types of items. I tried a number of other items in hopes that I could at least find one item that was somewhat enjoyable, however I left defeated and discouraged from ever coming here again.

Even though we paid $63.06 per person due to a large party of 10, to celebrate my sis-In-law's bday, we all figured that it will be worth it.  After all, Bacchanal was listed as the #1 Buffet in Vegas.  \\n\\nThe seating was ok.  We didn't have to wait long.  Considering it was a Saturday and the price is more expensive than regular weekday, I hurriedly went to the sushi bar since I've been craving for sushi.  To my dismay, there were only 4 varieties of sushi and no sashimi in the Japanese selection.   \\n\\nNext to the sushi are 2 selections each of pork buns and dumplings.  Along with 3 selections of different kinds of Asian soups.\\n\\nI went to the carving station and they only had brisket for beef, ribs, chicken & hot links.  You would think, for the price we paid, they would have prime rib.\\n\\n\\nOne of my favorite buffet must-haves are the oysters.  And to my surprise, they did not have any.  They had one of those white shells that look like clams.  So my family just went with the crab legs, as those were the only ones that were good enough.  We were told that we had to pay extra for the lobsters, but we were there until 4:30p,, but no lobsters in sight.  We were also told that lobsters are market price??? I've never heard of a buffet where you pay market price for lobsters!\\n\\nThe rest of the food is nothing much more than what you will get at maybe, Harrah's buffet for $26.  There were no teppanyaki, Mongolian or anything where you can have them cook special noodles for you.  Everything was like a regular all you can eat Chinese restaurant.\\n\\nThe dessert was pretty good, but not a huge selection.  Unlike the other fancy buffets in Vegas, there were no macarons or cakes or fro yo.\\n\\nThe worst thing of all was, my brother paid $15 for all you can drink beer & wine.  They only took his order once, never came back for any refill or anything.  So pretty much a waste of money.  We never got refills for any of our regular drinks, either.  \\n\\nOur go-to buffet in Vegas is the M Buffet.  I think for their price, they make it worth the line and money.  Their quality never is their priority.  I am extremely disappointed with the Bacchanal because to pay $600 for 1 meal for all of us, the selection was only worth half the price.  For a Saturday to have a menu of nothing different than a weekday menu, but costs more is unacceptable.\\n\\nI sincerely wish I researched before paying as the experience was not worth the price.  I hope The Bacchanal work on their quality or lower the price. I know everything in Vegas is expensive, but this one was like playing the slot machine and losing all your money.\",\n",

In fact, the only time I typically go to buffets is if I\\'m in a rush (so I can get my food and leave).  We stayed at Caesars over a weekend so decided since we were in the hotel, we might as well try it.  First off, let me just say I can\\'t believe anyone would wait in a lengthy line for a buffet.  When we walked by on Saturday night, the line was like one you would see at Disneyland in the prime months of summer (a 90 minute wait....just absurd, but people were waiting in it).

It wasn\\'t much of a line to get in, but there were still lines for all the food dishes.  The most impressive station appeared to be the Barbeque.  They offered Prime Rib, Spareribs, Ribeye, Lamb chops, sliders, Brisket of Beef, and Brats.  The Lamb Chops and sliders were very good.  The Brisket of Beef was fatty, and my wife said the Prime Rib was as tough as leather.  I didn\\'t indulge in the crab legs because the station was so busy.  The salad bar was picked over and looked pretty run down by the time we got there.  The pasta station was pretty typical.  The dessert bar was impressive (tried a couple of different ones).  As far as the \"500 items\" they advertised, I\\'d say it was about 450 items too many.  Honestly, I don\\'t see how anyone would expect the quality to be up to par with that many items.  This place is much more for people that just want a big quantity and want to gorge.  Admittedly paying $44.95 for dinner at this place is a bit of a ripoff.  FWIW, the best buffet in Vegas is the Wicked Spoon...HANDS DOWN!  I\\'ve been to all of the other nice ones and that is the only one I will venture to going forward.',\n",

We waited until 8:40 to be told we wouldn't be seated until 9:15 most likely, and for a party of two there was nothing they could do.

Its not like it was 9pm....7pm PRIME DINNER TIME and they ran out of lamb. Did i forget to mention there was a holiday surge price??? You'd expect they'd stock up their fridge.

       " \"Well we visited the Bacchanal on June 5 while staying at Caesars Palace.We wanted a good seafood buffet and decided this would be our choice. Big Big disappointment! Found seafood to be lacking, they have very limited choices . Snow crab no King  Crab unless you pay more. no lobster any shape or size to be found . nothing but cold shrimp, no fried shrimp! cold snow crab unless you want it from a pot of boiling water in the Italian section!You can't let crab sit in boiling water like that NO FLAVOR LEFT IN CRAB!!       \\nlittle cold plates of salmon,little cold baskets of chicken beautiful taco bar nobody ordering tacos because all condiments were out and stayed empty whole time we were there. Two stars are for the awesome meat station, but overall no one seemed to be walking the buffet to keep things full or clean. Meat was laying in front of station as was shrimp.  If all you want are oysters, cold crab and cold shrimp this is the place for u otherwise keep looking.Also the ticket gives you a 2 hour time limit that's a new one for me.\",\n",
       " 'Well...kinda disappointing. There was nothing spectacular that stood out food wise...great selection and variety of dishes most were Luke warm - cold. The seafood seemed previously frozen and when you cracked open the shells the meat fell apart like Parmesan cheese. The prime rib didn\\'t have much flavor...but nothing that was like \"ooh yum\" we paid for the \"endless drinks\" and then after 2 the staff took away our glasses and when I asked for more, he snarled you only get 2 with your meal..unless you pay $15 which I replied that we had paid the $15, it took him 15 minutes to come back with another drink and at one point I had to get up to get his attention... now mind you we are also still eating and not looking to drink down the house and get sloshed , but hey $30 between 2 people I would like to get my moneys worth...anyway the guy never came back to our table and the food was just meh...I\\'d rather pay for an uber and get a Korean bbq alll u can eat for $20 (which we did the next day)',\n",

Sushi was decent - nothing interesting. Thought the seafood portion was gross - some of the shrimp I had were slimy and didn't bother to eat.\",\n",

I had such high expectations for this buffet coming in, but unfortunately left disappointed and very underwhelmed. The quality of the food did not positively equate the $60 I paid. \\n\\nWhen I had searched up the buffet online, I had read that there was opulent dishes consisting of wagyu, sushi and tons of seafood. There was no wagyu and the sushi selection was pitiful as there was barely any selection. I was really looking forward to having some salmon sashimi, but there wasn't any. The prime rib tasted okay. \\nThe seafood didn't taste as fresh to me. I also felt like they were being stingy with the seafood because it wasn't being refilled quickly enough. The bone marrow looked good, but tasted purely of onions with no beef marrow taste at all. \\n\\nThe best things there were the pizza, dim sum and the dessert line. They're banana fosters crepes were super good. However, these are all cheap dishes in themselves and are hard to mess up. \\n\\nOverall the food wasn't bad, but the quality was more of a $30 buffet rather than a $60. I've had way better buffets in Vegas for a lot cheaper so I would save your money.\",\n",

You have to go to a kiosk to put your name in, the wait time for almost 3 hours. But wait, if you pay $25 per person, you can be a VIP and not have to wait so we decided to do that. It costs $168 for a BUFFET! I get it, we are in Vegas, everything is pricey but come on!!!! Ok, so the food, there was a boat load of it but overall, it wasn't that great, wasn't horrible either. The deserts looked great but they didn't taste very well at all. A lot of wasted food. Would I recommend this place? Absolutely not!\",\n",
       " \"Giving two stars for the food only. The food was good and hot and they had a nice variety. I hate the fact you have tip up front, you never know what kind of service you are going to get. My husband has a tendency to overtip and our waiter was horrible. I got the endless mimosas for an extra $22 on an already over $100 bill. In the two hours we were there, I got one refill for a total of two mimosas. When we were ready to leave, we had to flag down a bus boy to take our bill and credit card. When he brought back the receipt, they had the nerve to ask for another tip. We put a large zero on that line. With the endless mimosas they advertise that you get a souvenir glass. I had to flag down the bus boy yet again to ask for the souvenir glass. He told me the glass was the one I had been drinking from, which still had some mimosa left in it. Just what I want to do, carry around a dirty sticky glass (we were not staying at that hotel). I asked him if he would wash it out for me and he said they normally don't, but he would anyway. I wish the tip we left up front had gone to him and not our waiter as we had more interaction and service from the bus boy. The food was good, but don't expect good service, it wasn't even that busy, we had to wait about 10 minutes in line. I would hate to see the service on a busy night. We won't be returning.\",\n",
       " \"Not worth the hassle.  Food was only okay.  Nothing special.  Hard to be impressed by so-so renditions of everything.  Nothing was outright terrible from a food perspective, just don't know why everyone is preening about how awesome it is.  Maybe part of it is the hunger effect where everything tastes better because you're starving because you've waited almost two hours to get in.  Or you've bought an expensive dud and don't want to admit it.  From the reviews, lots and lots of people love this buffet, just not me.  Maybe my memory is hazy but the last few Vegas buffets I went to I enjoyed the experience much more.  \\n\\nThere are $15 cheap buffets back home that have much tastier (though less pricey) food.  Anything Asian there is done better by thousands of local joints back at people's hometown, wherever it may be.  Ditto for the Italian, seafood, prime rib and meats, and deserts, and whatever else I ended up getting from their troughs.  If for food alone, maybe 2 stars.  Price and service adjusts downward to one star.  As I was eating I kept thinking about those generic places you see with A#1 Best American food, and Chinese food, and Italian, etc plastered all over their store frontage.  \\n\\nPrice is what it is.  Up to individual preference on whether you think it's reasonable.  To me the cost/benefit was way out of whack.  \\n\\nService is terrible.  First, I don't mind prices in this range generally, but then as seems typical with popular Vegas buffets , you get treated like cattle, low rent cattle at that.  My fault really, I should have just gone for a nice meal somewhere.  Travel channel and the like suckered me into wanting to experience the classic Vegas buffet.  \\n\\nThe check in time/text thing they do is a good tool, but executed poorly.  You still have to unnecessarily stand around for another 45 min/hour after they tell you to come back to hang out in a glacially slow line.  Shorten that time a bit and the experience would be much better.  Restaurants I've been to that give you pagers don't page you and then ask you to wait almost an hour afterward.  Vegas is bigger with more room to roam than a restaurant parking lot, but this process could be much more refined and optimized.\\n\\n5 cashiers, great.  Except they spend most of their time standing around not ringing people up because the line moves too slow.  They probably only need 3 of them based on how the line worked-- 2 to handle the VIP gamblers and such (really only need 1, but they're VIP!!! and of course can't have any sort of line to wait in)  that went to the front of the line and only 1 to handle the hundreds of other regular cattle.  It felt like more than half their time was spent standing around doing no work and not looking at the massive line of people standing there waiting to pay.  Not their fault really as the massive line of people who had paid was backed up to the cashiers with little room for more. Refer back to the comment about handling the line better.  \\n\\nInside decor is fine, except don't know why they choose such cheap looking tables and chairs.  Read a bit about how much money they spent on the place and was surprised that it felt like the tables and chairs were from a 1980s Denny's or Sizzlers.  I normally don't care too much about furnishings and wouldn't have mentioned it except it seemed weirdly out of place in something trying to be the top buffet in town.  Maybe the word buffet is my answer and underneath all the hype is just that, a buffet.\",\n",

       " 'This will only be the second time in the 5 years i have been on Yelp that I\\'m giving somewhere a 1 star review....thats how bad my experience was here. Do not waste your money on this buffet. We had not 1, but 2 bad experiences here! Let me break it down for you as i see it:\\n\\nQuality of food: 2-3 stars\\nSelection of food: 2 stars\\nAtmosphere: 4 stars\\nCleanliness: 1 star\\nManagement: ZERO (first zero I have ever given to a restaurant EVER)\\n\\nWe showed up for dinner on a Sunday evening for dinner at about 8:30pm. We were told by the hostess that they were at capacity and were not taking in any more customers until no sooner than 9:30. Me and my party decided to wait until 9:30 since it was raining and didn\\'t feel like walking somewhere else. So at 9:10 my friend checks with the hostess to see if we can get in before 9:30. She says no we are still not letting people in and it will be no sooner than 9:30 before we can enter. Great, nothing wrong with that...as we are standing there waiting (no more than 2 mins later) as we are standing 40 feet away she starts letting people in! So my friend walks back over to see whats going on and she says \"Ok we will take you now.\" WTF!\\n\\nSo now we are in line, which starts after the hostess stand we wait another 10-15 mins to get up to the counter to pay. As we are paying they tell us that they will be pulling all the food off the serving stations @ 10:30pm. So we are like okay, no problem. We waited this long to eat, that still gives us about an hour to eat...no problem. So we pay and once again....we wait....in line....again. This time for another 10 mins. They are finally ready to seat us. While we are being shown to our table we notice that there is a HUGE line at the buffet inside the restaurant! The line had to have been another 15-20 mins long. After seeing the line we realized that there was no way we had time to stand in the line every time you wanted something from the main buffet station and still eat our food in what was now less than an hour from when they took the food away. Mind you this buffet with tax was costing us $58 per person. If this was the case they should not be letting more paying customers in.\\n\\nWe ask to speak with a manger and got our money refunded back to us and we leave....but we still haven\\'t eaten and all the good restaurants in Vegas close at 10pm. We ended having to eat at some diner because we waited for so long and now nothing else was open. \\n\\nNext day....for some ungodly reason we attempt to go back, this time to their breakfast buffet. We arrive at 11:03am, they inform us that they are now serving the \"Lunch Buffet, breakfast buffet stopped at 11am sharp\" and that the price will now be $40 per person instead of $18 (i think). Whatever, it was after 11am so i\\'m not complaining.....HOWEVER....wait for it.....the party in line with us is PISSED! We can hear the guy complaining to a manger...\"we have been in line for over 20 mins and you wouldn\\'t let us in! Now that it\\'s 11:01 you are going to let us in just so you can charge us more money!\" I totally felt for this guy, i have no doubt that he was right. And they were a party of 7 so that\\'s really a lot more money. And here\\'s the kicker...they were still serving breakfast food for the duration of the time we were inside!\\n\\nSo now we get to the table, go get our plates and wait in the line for the main buffet station for about 15 mins to get up there and find that there really wasn\\'t even a good selection. I think they had 3 different meats to choose from and no crab legs. They did however have Lobster corn chowder, so i got a bowl....it was cold. FML....\\n\\nThe whole experience was HORRIBLE...2 days prior we ate at the lunch buffet at Aria and it was awesome. All the prime rim, crab legs and sushi you could eat....and it was only $30 per person. Go there....go anywhere....just don\\'t go to the buffet at Caesar\\'s Palace. What a disappointment, prob the worst restaurant experience of my life.',\n",
       " \"Service has gone down hill here from the last time I came. When we arrived we were told we could wait in line for 25 mins or pay an extra $25 per person (total $80+). We also paid for the all you can drink option. When we got to the table we were told that someone would come get our drink order.  10 mins passed, someone came took our drink order. 15 mins more passed we got our first drinks for just our water and soda. Our beers still didn't make it to it to the table. \\n\\nAfter bugging a few more people we finally got our first batch of beers.  After complaining about it again we started getting a flow of  drinks. When they started bringing our drinks to us they set a tray filled with mixed drinks & beer behind us for 15 mins which means another table missed out on their drinks too. \\n\\nThe food overall was meh. We had some items that tasted great, most however was over cooked or just meh for the amount of money. The deserts however were all good.  Honestly for the money there are a lot better restaurants in Vegas that have much better food for the money.\",\n",
       " 'With all the hype I was excited for gourmet food, great presentation and the option to try a few new dishes. After 90 minutes in line we discovered a buffet less impressive than Bellagio and on par with the Wynn. Salads were limited, desserts were left uneaten, and there was no shortage of pizza and Mexican food.  Crab legs were the highlight for me but for the price I would rather order a King crab leg dinner at a nice restaurant (these were skimpy but plentiful). I took away stars for the gutsy move to price this meal at $50.',\n",
       " \"The lines are too long and they manage the lines horribly. There are 5 different lines. Two lines for VIP and seven star?!. 3 lines are divided into 1 or 2 people, 3-5 people and more than 5 people groups. We've been waiting for two hours since we were party of two. People who were behind us with other group of lines were even much faster. I guess they have fewer number of tables for 1 or two people. I think this is terrible management and unfair.. I do not recommend this restaurant.\",\n",
       " \"The 1 star is for the dessert. I do not know why all the food are so salty, it's for us to eat less in the buffet? All food we got only can have a bite, cannot eat more. Only the dessert is good. Will not go or recommend anybody to this buffet, worst buffet I ever had. Food from the pic is firstly we got when we enter, I don't give review, but this buffet totally disappointed, the top rated vegas buffet.\",\n",
       " 'I was really looking forward to coming here.  I am not a fan of buffets, but with the reviews this place had received I was really looking forward to eating.\\n\\nMy complaint is not about the food.  The food was good.  It was decent, not over the top because obviously it is z buffet.\\n\\nMy complaint lies in the manner my guests and me were seated.  We were given a table to the very back of the establishment.  When we asked if we could be up closer we were told that was not possible.  When we asked why we were told that it was due to casino rules. \\n\\nAfter paying a rather large sum for dinner it was really not acceptable to not be able to allow us to change to a nicer table, especially when there were many available.  This was not a case of discrimination but rather a case of over elitism.\\n\\nI will not return and neither will my dinner guests.',\n",
       " 'We gave this place two stars but they think they are a five star buffet apparently. First, it took us 20 minutes of standing in line on a Monday night. No biggie though as we were expecting the place to be amazing. \\n\\nWhen it came time to pay, before being seated, there was a hassle, which seemed to require an act of congress to resolve. They check photo id\\'s along with debit cards for every transaction. I totally understand they want to be safe so it\\'s all good, my wife presented her ID. \\n\\nProblem was, my wife\\'s name on ID didn\\'t match her debit card name due to us just getting married. The name was so close most would let it slide, but not here. Again, no problem as we are being understanding. My wife pulls marriage certificate out of her purse on the spot just to reassure them she is the same person on the debit card. The employee ringing us up wouldn\\'t even look at it! She called over a manager for this? Wow! Ok! Manager comes over and asks for my ID also. I feel like we were being interrogated to give them about $125 worth of business! Finally, after about 10 minutes we were cleared of all suspicion and allowed to pay.\\n\\nAgain, we don\\'t complain about the issue paying and let it go. We get to our table and notice it was a super small table cramped between many other tables at one of those combo table/booths. We knew that wouldn\\'t work for us since not much would have fit on that table, and with my disabilities from the military. We ended up going to another table no big deal.\\n\\nAt the buffet line there are of course many foods to choose from which is expected of a buffet, but many dishes you don\\'t really know what they are. There are signs above the dish (well that\\'s their plan anyways), but some signs are missing while some are in the wrong spot which can get confusing. You naturally ask the person on the other side what the dish is... But most either don\\'t speak English to tell you, or they can\\'t hear you which requires you to yell. Who wants to deal with eating their dinner with family or friends and hearing people yelling to talk at the buffet line next to you? We still don\\'t complain at this point and let it go.\\n\\nAt one point, my wife and I felt like we were bothering a lady working behind the hamburger slider counter just for asking a question about the type of cheese used. She seemed as if she had better things to do than do her job at work. By her response you would have thought we had asked for a secret family recipe at a loved one\\'s funeral! Again though... We don\\'t complain and let it go.\\n\\nThe register we were told closes at 10:00 pm, but the buffet itself we were told closes at 10:30 pm. We had already pre-paid of course but we wanted to ensure we were done eating by 10:30 to be respectful. At 9:45 pm the place was really dying down and there were not a lot of customers around  anymore. Yet we still had a very difficult time getting service. We tried to get the attention of four servers who walked near us but they acted like they couldn\\'t hear us. Two of them actually looked at us and kept walking! When we finally got the attention of a server he made it clear to us that he was not our server, but said he would get us more water anyways. He told us that our server was actually in the back office doing some paperwork. Really??!!! Again we didn\\'t complain to anybody. \\n\\nThe first plates we were done with were taken away from our table with no problems, but after that they quit taking our old dishes on their own. We would get back to the table with new plates of food and the table was still full of things that should have been long gone. We had to ask someone to take our dishes when we could finally get their attention. Still we did not complain at all.\\n\\nHere is what got the most frustrating. This topped it all off and required a complaint to the manager. \\n\\nWe were getting food at the buffet at 9:50 and all of the signs that give you name of the dish were gone! Remember, many were already either wrong or missing in the beginning, but now they were all gone! As I walked down the line I noticed the food was either being pulled or had been pulled in many areas! 40 minutes before closing??!!! Unreal! If you pay about $60 per person for a buffet you have higher expectations usually. Well, at least we did. I don\\'t think that\\'s unreasonable though.\\n\\nFinally, we politely ask for a manager who comes over. By this time it was 10 pm according to his watch. The buffet should have been open for another 30 minutes. We proceed to quietly and tactfully share all of the problems with him, and he said he was sorry. He asked if there was anything else we needed from him. Hmmmm.... Ok. That was awkward. We told him no. We finished our meal and left.\\n\\nSo, as you see... The service was bad. However, the food itself was good (why two stars) can\\'t deny that. Not great but good. They encourage you to \"get all the food you want even if you can\\'t eat it all because at the end of the night we throw it all away anyways.\" Sad.',\n",
       " \"Had the service been even remotely acceptable, I would have comfortably rated Bacchanal 4 stars. \\n\\nMy SO and I have made it a point to try all of the high-end strip buffets since moving to Las Vegas two years ago and Bacchanal was the final stop on our list. \\n\\nAs far as the food quality is concerned, Bacchanal is right up there with the other top contenders like the Wicked Spoon. In fact, the seafood and Asian selections are probably the best I've had at any buffet. The carving station, Mexican, American, and Italian food were all solid as well, though not exceptional. The dessert offerings were also above average quality, the Gelato and French Macarons were particularly delicious.\\n\\nThat being said, I will most likely not be visiting Bacchanal again because the service was absolutely deplorable. After the host grabbed three separate parties from the secondary line to be seated, we were forced to run and weave between tables to keep up with her and find our seats after we made stops to have the other two parties seated first, of course. We were sat and told to begin eating when we were ready and that our server would be by shortly. Our server did not show up for a FULL half hour after we had been seated to finally ask what we would like to drink. He brought our drinks out soon after and that was the last we saw of him for an hour. Not only that, but we were forced to go take fresh napkin and utensil sets from another open table as we were never given any nor were we able to flag down anyone to help us. Our plates were removed from the table exactly one (1) time in the almost two hours that we were at the restaurant, so we had to take matters into our own hands and take our finished plates to other empty tables in order to clear our own. \\n\\nWhen you're paying $65 per person plus tip for dinner, service like this is absolutely unacceptable. We've gotten infinitely finer service at the Cannery buffet where breakfast for 2 runs about 12 dollars with the club card. While the food was fantastic, the quality of service was nowhere near where it should be for a restaurant of this caliber and the great food was not enough to overcome the horrendous service. We'll take our money to Wicked Spoon or even the Studio B Buffet at the M Resort next time we're in the mood to splurge on an upscale buffet\",\n",

Can't even be romantic for those having dates. Another is we had to ask our server 3 times to refill our soda. Very poor service.\\n\\nFood overall is alright. My husband and I went straight to the carving station. They just cut the steak for you. You can't request the doneness or however you like your steak. I prefer those ones that they cook it for you on the spot. Little disappointed with their Japanese option. \\n\\nFINAL NOTE: Sure, it has a lot of option and it's pretty over whelming but if you're after good food and flavor, this is not the place for you. If you just wanna pig out, this maybe the place for you. In all fairness, All food presentation is nice. Everything looks appetizing. So, $150 dinner for 2? Not worth it.

       " \"***Over Rated!****\\n3 hour wait with high expectations., but were disappointed.  We have tried many vegas buffets and were expecting Bacchanal to hold its own like Wynn's buffet, but was more like MGM's, or maybe Rio's buffet.  $56.99 per person.  crab was big, but same size as elsewhere.  The carving station looked awesome, lamb chops were good, but the prime rib was tough. Noodle bar was okay...  We basically had a $32.99 buffet dinner for $56.99.  We will not be returning here.\",\n",
       " \"I'm not one to write reviews-- I just use Yelp to read other reviews, but I felt really inclined to write one for Bacchanal because of how disappointed I am after coming here all the time in the past 2 years. I moved to Vegas in 2013 and tried Bachannal for the first time then. If I wrote this review back then-- 5 stars for sure!!! We have lots of out of town guests that visit, and the first place we always recommend for dinner and take them to is this buffet. Each time we come here to dine (probably has been at least 10 times in the past 2 years and always with a large group), we notice the quality has gone down hill. The main reason this was my favorite spot was because of the hot king crab legs. I just treated my parents to dinner here last week after talking this place all up, especially the king crab legs because they love them, and to my surprise, now they are served mixed with the snow crabs. When I got my plate, I had one king crab out of like 20 snow crabs. My dad got a plate and he didn't have any king crab and when he specifically asked for just a few king crab legs, the lady behind the station just shrugged and said they were premixed and basically too bad. I just dined here late last summer with a group of 10+ out of towners and they didn't mix up the king and snow crab and we all thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at Bacchanal. Well worth the price then. Now that you get 1 king crab leg with a plateful of snowcrab legs, I don't think we will be returning and bringing all of our out of town guests (which we have plenty coming all year round) to this buffet anymore. I do not think the price justifies what you get now that they are making cuts with the quality of food you get at the buffet. Also, we came in to dine for dinner on a weekday at 5pm and I did not expect for them to run out of my favorite (truffle au gratin potatoes). Not a big deal but after finding out about the cutbacks on king crab legs, then my other favorite buffet item ran out for the day, I left very unhappy.. and feeling jipped. I guess we will be taking our family and friends and out of towners elsewhere.. as well as my hubby and I celebrating our special occasions elsewhere. So sad...I really did like this buffet...\",\n",

       " 'Not what it was. I have been going to Bacchanal since it opened and last nights visit showed its losing ground to the best buffet in Las Vegas. Food was lackluster and a lot of it had been sitting out for a while. On a weds night dont put out so much food when its not that busy . Every hot dish that was under a heat lamp was lukewarm. And the crab legs were so small I thought i was at Red Lobster, sad.  We brought this to the attention of the manager and he was apologetic and asked could he have the kitchen make us something up. A nice gesture but i brought a visitor here to impress them. They were not impressed. As a local here there are many better options . Sorry to see it go .',\n",

It was around 11:30 and the line wasn't too bad, only took about 10 minutes to pay and get seated, the total was $125 for 3, my Wife, 10 year old son and myself.\\n\\nWe get seated and hit up the buffet.

Didn't matter what station or what item. Eggs ,bacon,macaroni, grits,waffles,brisket,meatballs all cold. If it had any warmth to it, it was dried out as the fried chicken was.\\n\\nAnother issue was that lots of the items were just way too salty, and this is a trend I'm noticing at a lot of places now. People are confusing well seasoned to lots of salt. The only really solid items were the preprepared stuff like cold cuts, cheeses. Lots of other tables seemed to be enjoying the crab legs and shrimp, I didn't have any so I can't vouch for them\\n\\nThe highlight was the desert station, which seemed to be the most popular, they had a everything from gelato to pastries and gummi bears.\\n\\nNow based on all the rave reviews I am seeing here on yelp, I either went on an off day or a very slow day and maybe this is the reason thing were cold and salty as they weren't being switched out as much as they should be.\\n\\nI have no issue with buffets as a matter of fact if this were a $15 buffet it would have rocked and I would be much more forgiving, but at $50+ per person, it better be good, and it wasn't, like I said earlier there are 100's of choices of good places to eat in Vegas within 1 miles of this buffet at the same price point. Next time I'm in Vegas I'tt try one of those other places.\",\n",
       " 'I have been coming to the Bacchanal buffet on an annual basis and have raved about it--even though the price was steep.  I had always felt it was worth the value.  That is why I was so disappointed with my dinner last Friday evening at about 5:30 (after checking in before 4.). They called us back and then we had to wait to pay and wait to be seated and we were a party of 2.\\n\\nIt seemed as is the buffet had turned from an out of the ordinary buffet experience to a mediocre one.  First, almost no King crab.  They claim to offer a combination of snow crab and King crab, but mostly you get snow.  This was true at the cold seafood station and at the Italian station.  It wasn\\'t that I got the dregs, I saw the chef transferring the crab from the cold container to heat it up and there was barely a King crab leg in sight.  \\n\\nOn the meat station--where they used to have rack of lamb and prime rib, they served \"wagyu\" steamship round.  Didn\\'t have any marbling and looked tough.  They did serve individual lamb chops, but mine was tough and not well seasoned.  The sushi was dry (fish was curling up on the nigiri and rice was also dry).  The Chinese items were meh, although the char sir bao was good.  The stir fried crab was not tasty-- saw a lot of uneaten crab on other diners\\' plates as well.  \\n\\nOn the Italian station, the meatball was good and the truffled gnocchi was good as well.\\n\\n\\nThe only highlight was the truffle mushroom soup, which was truly delicious and reminiscent of the old Bacchanal offerings.  \\n\\nThe dessert bar was good, but seemed to have fewer offerings.  No more soufflés or mochi ice cream :(\\n\\nService-- terrible.  Waitress took order,  brought drinks, then disappeared.  No apparent replacement.  Dirty dishes remained.  Dirty dishes everywhere, including our neighbor\\'s table where the dirty stuff was left there for over 1/2 hour.  Unappetizing and unacceptable.\\n\\nSad to say, unless this improves, my annual trip to Las Vegas will not include a stop here.',\n",

       " \"I'm a native to Las Vegas having lived here my entire life, over 40 years. I grew up in the hotel and gaming community and if there is a buffet in Vegas, I'm sure I've eaten at it. So when I heard all the hype about the Bacchanal Buffet (named after the old Bacchanal restaurant of Caesars Palace ages ago) I was dying to try it. I've already experienced several of the other major buffets in Las Vegas such as the one at the Bellagio and my personal favorite, Wicked Spoon over at Cosmo, so my hopes were high for this place. I must say, my high hopes were let down.\\n\\nMy first experience with the Bacchanal Buffet was about a month after it opened. My wife and I decided to go down and check it out. It was mid-week, about 7 PM when we arrived. Much to my amazement, the line to get in looked like the line for the Matterhorn at Disneyland on Labor Day weekend. My jaw hit the ground when I found out it would be a THREE HOUR WAIT to get in. That's right, a THREE HOUR WAIT! I'm sorry, there is no buffet in the history of the world worth that. Anyone willing to stand in such a line needs to get their head examined. Oh, but wait, for an extra few bucks you can pay to get into a shorter line...what an insult! We left, but not before I asked to speak to a restaurant manager about this insanity. \\n\\nA young woman, still in her 20's introduced herself as the head assistant manager. I questioned why they had a line this long and didn't use a pager system or numbers or something like that. Hello?! They came up with these ideas 30 years ago! This girl looked at me like I was speaking Martian. The mere concept of this went so far over her head she looked like a deer in headlights. Evidently, this is the new system that Caesars Palace has implemented...get rid of anyone with experience or knowledge of the industry because they cost too much and, instead, hire kids right out of college with a Hospitality degree to run a multi-million dollar restaurant as a General Manager for $50,000/year. This is what happens when your flag-ship property is run by amateurs after a buy out. It's like McDonalds trying to run a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse like a McDonalds. Insane. After this brief conversation that went nowhere, we left.\\n\\nFast forward a few months, it was my birthday. My wife knew I wanted to go to the Bacchanal so she took me there as we decided to give it a second try. We went on a Wednesday at 8PM. The hotel was empty but there was still an atrocious 45 minute wait. INSANE. Once inside, our first impression was that it was very nice inside but nothing special. We actually were shocked at how small the seating area was, which would probably explain why the turnover of tables was so slow.\\n\\nthe food was wonderful but in many cases it suffered the same problems that many buffets suffer from and that's batches of food left under heat lamps. Much of the food was hot but much of it was barely warm. The crab legs were a nice touch but by far nothing special. I've had better at Red Lobster or Joes Crab Shack. Seriously, no joke.  The desserts were certainly the high point of the buffet and we enjoyed several of the different offerings.\\n\\nMy overall experience of the Bacchanal Buffet was that it was a fair value for the price but the insanely long wait to get in dropped what would be a 4 star review down to a 2 star. It is not worth the wait...not even close. What baffles the mind though is how not one executive at Caesars Palace has not screamed at them over this process. You have people waiting in line for HOURS when they could be putting money in slot machines or playing the tables. Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! I'm amazed that people haven't been fired over this and I'm even more amazed that the wait process still exists. It's run by idiots with no common sense.\\n\\nSarah Jane, one of the top reviewers of this restaurant is even a good friend of mine and because of her relationship with Yelp, she got right in and never had to wait for the gruelingly long line to eat here. She has even told me that if she had to wait an hour or more to eat here she would have dropped her review down a lot too. \\n\\nMy wife and I eat at nice restaurants all the time and the price tag to eat at the Bacchanal seems fair minus the long line. Until they expand with more tables to accommodate more people and change the line system we will not return. We much prefer Wicked Spoon.\",\n",

The manager on site told them \"about 20 minutes\" however it was clear it would take at least an hour. After requesting and receiving my refund, I felt obligated to let them know the manager was not being truthful and from their spot in line to my spot (about 10 feet) it would take 45 to an hour on top of another hour from my spot (after paying) to the front before being seated. \\n\\nI\\'m not sure how bachannal is ran, however, it is pretty clear the online \"pre-reservation\" to save a time for you to come in to eat is pretty useless, the horrendous management, and average quality food is not worth your time.',\n",

Dim sums are also taste like those you can buy from grocery store, I am pretty sure they don't make their own dim sum, they just buy tons of frozen one and serve it.

What I mean by that is that there are lots of angles and corners so it's pretty easy to get boxed in or out when a crowd forms, which was normal. \\n\\nThe setup to get in to the buffet was the worst I've ever seen. Consistently, there was just one person taking peoples $$ causing a huge multiple hour long queue to form. Alternatively, you could pay an additional $15PP to cut through the line. On that side, there were 2 or 3 people checking people in at any given time. The check-in folks were clueless to the unrest of the crowd and offered no apologizes from the long and unnecessary wait (the dining was NOT full by any means). \\n\\nThe waitstaff seemed to be overworked. I ordered a soda and was given 2 glasses of soda, presumably because we would never see our waiter again, which was the case. \\n\\nI still say Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan is the best buffet in vegas...I'll avoid Bacchanal in the future.\",\n",

This is the longest line and it's causing traffic.  When I asked why many tables of 6 were being seated before us, the reason was because it was a big table... I apologize but I don't care how good the food is, this is poor management.  I will not be coming back.  I did not pay 70 dollars per person to wait over 2 hours and being told that food stops at 1015. (It is currently 942... and yes I can walk away but I've already paid and I am f***ing hungry!)\\n\\nYes,  this is a 1 star because of service.\",\n",
       " \"This buffet did not stand out as I thought it would for the price. For 2 people it cost $124.00 plus tip (that you pay up front). I expected at the very least a nice table and food that exceeded your average/everyday buffet that I can get in my home town. I had to squeeze past other people's tables and move empty chairs out of the way to get to my table at every trip to and from the buffet. After leaving a $20 tip, my husband and I had to flag waiter down more than once to get water refill. As far as the food, I have been to Vegas many times and you can get better quality and selections at many other buffets in Vegas at a much lower price. I will not be returning.\",\n",
       " \"Las Vegas has many different buffets and I was really excited to try Bacchanal. However, I can see why it's reputation has been on the downward spiral lately. \\n\\nFor one, our hostess had a poor attitude. We had a party of five and she stuck us in the middle section of a very small area where it was difficult for us to maneuver in and out of our chairs. Our neighbors bumped into us on multiple occasions getting in and out of their seats. Not their fault necessarily but I wasn't happy. After about 20 minutes, I got tired of playing human Tetris through the crowd of others around us and asked the hostess for another table. My request was met with her being snotty and pretending to check our table receipt to make sure we paid for everyone. I find it really ironic that once she saw how small our seated table was, she still had the nerve to question us. Why not accept you put a large party in a table meant for 3-4 people? Vashna, I think that's her name, should get a clue and personality adjustment.\\n\\nNow on to the food, which I will admit saved the evening for me. The servers and culinary folks working the stations were accommodating. Shout out to the man working the taco bar! Best items IMO; mussels, paella, shrimp and cocktail sauce, lasagna. I would skip the fried chicken and waffles and other things that look like they could have been kept out for a bit. Biggest disappointment was the lack of fresh squeezed juice bottles! Although the people working the counters said we could special order, that wasn't the case.\\n\\nFinal verdict? If you have your heart set on a buffet experience, there are plenty of other options around the strip.\",\n",

This is what happened, the restaurant have a fast lane for an extra $15, you'll be seated in less than 10 minutes. If you can eat $75 (plus tax) of food, go ahead and knock yourself out. If you are in the slow line, you are held back until 1.5 hrs before they close. at this point, they let everyone in for the left overs. Don't waste your time and money.\",\n",

       " 'After reading the hype once Caesar\\'s Palace decided to upgrade Cafe Lago, I made a point on my next trip to Vegas to visit Bacchanal Buffet, which happened to be for breakfast ($25 with a Total Rewards card).  Overall, I liked the modern feel of the space with plenty of tables for large groups (8+) and somewhat uncharacteristic lounge music playing in the background.  The food, though, was pretty standard (and bordering on outright disappointing) in terms of breakfast/brunch buffets.\\n\\nTo start with, Total Rewards Diamond and Seven Stars members get little signs as they are walked through the restaurant that are placed at their table.  While perhaps off-putting to an outsider, it is interesting to see how you are more likely to see the elderly, stingy video poker playing couple or upper-middle aged overweight blackjack/craps player eating by themselves than, for instance, Jay Gatsby in a tuxedo.  It goes to show that gambling in Las Vegas doesn\\'t look quite like what the mailers picture it to be.\\n\\nI digress.  As I mentioned before, the breakfast food was pretty standard with the highlight being the carving station featuring brisket, ham, and a variety of what they termed \"artisanal sausages.\"  Mind you, the sausages themselves--which usually had some extra spices or other ingredients mixed in--were just okay.  \\n\\nOther sections of the buffet try to put out individual servings of popular dishes but end up failing miserably.  Corned beef hash in a 2-inch bowl with a tiny egg (nice touch) but a scant few traces of corned beef among the potato shreds was a disgrace.  Chicken and waffles as a quarter Belgian waffle and a chicken wing is just wrong.  The mini-pancakes were dry, though they did a slightly better job with the French toast.  The Asian section had some steamed pork buns and basic Chinese food.  I would have loved to have seen some freshly cooked fish choices for those looking for more of a Japanese-style breakfast.\\n\\nOn the plus side, I did like the large selection of juices served in individual-sized glass milk bottles.  It\\'s more visually appealing and keeps the crowds moving faster than a Minute Maid dispenser or a couple of large carafes for self-service.\\n\\nWhile the overall environment (i.e., everything except the food) is top-notch, in my opinion, the breakfast offerings at Bellagio and Paris\\'s buffets are superior.  In reality, though, if your level of play starts to get items taken off the hotel bill, your choice of breakfast buffet should be dictated by where you\\'re staying or doing most of your gambling.  I don\\'t think any buffet in Vegas is so much better than the others as to overcome the presumptive choice of free food.',\n",
       " 'The food here might be ok but the entire experience was a nightmare. Getting in, we had to wait in 2 very very long lines. One to get a ticket to come back at a later time and then when coming back at the specified time on your ticket, you won\\'t get in right away...you have to wait in another line for 2 hours!!!! The staff \"managing\" the line are very rude and herd people like they are sheep!!! \\nIf you want to be disrespected, and pay good money for mediocre food, then this place fits you perfectly!!!',\n",
       " 'Like most places in Vegas, this buffet is overrated. After reading the reviews here, my girlfriend and I were so excited to try what most people call the best buffet in Vegas. \\n\\nI recommend that you go to this buffet a little before 3 pm. This way the line is very short, you pay the lunch price rather than the dinner price, and you can eat dinner items because they will be serving it starting at 3 pm. \\n\\nThe service sucked (see below). The food was just okay. Not crappy, but not great if you are paying $50 a person. I\\'ll go in order:\\n\\nThe salad ingredients were fresh, but that\\'s not hard. Their \"cheese\" menu was severely lacking -- there were only 3 kinds of cheese, and they were all extra sharp. The soups were cold because most people want to make their money by focusing on the expensive meats, so the soups just sit there and hardly anyone eats them -- I love clam chowder, but theirs was cold and lumpy. I asked them if they could warm it up and they said it was a fresh batch. (It wasn\\'t a fresh batch.)\\n\\nThe Asian ramen stand is good, and although I don\\'t usually like tofu, theirs was really good. However, you can get a lot of good ramen from asian restaurants for a lot less money (and you should probably avoid ramen at buffets because it is so filling). \\n\\nMy favorite item was the creamy salmon, but none of the sides were good, so eating just salmon was boring. The crab was a little too salty. The prime rib only comes in medium rare -- disgusting. The \"lobster\" corn chowder barely had any lobster, and in any case was not very good.\\n\\nI didn\\'t try the taco station because I live in San Diego, home of the best tacos in the country. But people kept lining up for them, so maybe they are worth a try.\\n\\nThe dessert was lacking as well. The gelato section looks interesting, but there is a line for it, and they only give you one little scoop per visit. I had to wait in line three times to try 3 flavors. They all tasted like frozen yogurt, and not the good kind. The cheesecake only came in sugar-free form. (What?)\\n\\nAll we wanted for drinks were hot tea, but they don\\'t have tea pots. Instead, they use their coffee pots and just add water to them. So the tea just tastes like old coffee. We kept asking the server if they could wash them out and she said all she can do is add water. The tea was just horrible because it just tasted like bad coffee.\\n\\nThey make sure the most filling items are well stocked, so people get full faster at a lower cost to them. We\\'ve definitely been to better buffets that cost much less.',\n",
       " 'We just went to this \"high end\" buffet on Sunda (11/11/12) and it is HANDS DOWN the worst buffet I have been to.  Oh, and the cost for 2....$118!\\n\\nFirst of all, the line was extremely long.  And I get this, as most buffet lines are long.  but there is no organization at all.  There are no employees to tell you where to go, when to go pay at the register, who\\'s turn it is, etc.  Even the poor cashiers were confused and had no idea who was next in line.  We stood in the \"Express Line\" as we decided to fork over the extra $15/person so we didn\\'t have to wait in the regular line.  Although we only had 3 other parties in front of us, we still waited for over 20 minutes.\\n\\nSo we finally get in, get seated and grab our plates.  Now keep in mind, this is supposed to be a very high end buffet.  There is NOTHING amazing, upscale, etc. about this buffet.  We ate at the Planet Hollywood buffet on Saturday, and it was so much better!  The Bacchanal buffet features various stations, but of course they dont have any signs, so you have NO CLUE what you are in line for.  The sushi stations is the smallest I have ever seen, and it\\'s the usual california roll and spicy tuna.  SUSHI WAS NASTY!!!\\n\\nEverything else I tasted was NOT FRESH, NOT TASTY, and certainly NOT WORTH $118!\\n\\nThis was the first and only buffet review I have ever done, as I have NEVER been so dissapointed.\\n\\nIf you want a great buffet, go to Wicked Sppon at Cosmopolitan or the Bellagio buffet.  Planet Hollywood is a good 3/5 as well.  But trust me on this one, stay away from Bacchanal until they get their crap together.',\n",

Most of the dishes are meant to fill you up like french fries, fried chicken, over cooked meats, sushi rolls, breads, tacos, chow mein, etc.  \\n\\nAlso the wait is ridiculously long...  If you don't want to pay for the mandatory 18% tip for a party of 8 or more then the wait can be 2 hours long.  But you do go with the 8+ larger group the wait is shorter.  I know they get you in everyway.  Not cool.\\n\\nVegas buffets are going downhill.  This is supposed to be one of the best ones but I have this place twice and both times it has disappointed me.

She picked up our check and loudly asked us if we needed change, which we did not. Keep in mind you pay for everything before you eat here. Then she said \"I didn\\'t see anything on the check.\" It became obvious she was asking for a tip. As we left and were not walking out, she sarcastically told us to havbe a great day. Extremely rude and not acceptable when you are paying close to $50 a person for a weekend lunch.',\n",
       " '2.5 stars. Came here during MDW so dinner was $75. Definitely not worth the price, but I knew that before eating here and still wanted to try it. There was soooo much variety on the buffet and I tried as much as possible. Here comes my review: \\n\\nMeat station: \\n\\nThe carved meat was okay, but lukewarm which brought it down a bit. It also wasn\\'t seasoned very well so I was quite disappointed. I tried the BBQ sauce, which was good and helped increasing the flavor for all the meats I tried but I was still disappointed because this is supposed to be the \"best\" of the buffet and it was not living up to my standards. The mac and cheese was soooo good as was the mashed potatoes. I also tried the onion rings, french fries and sweet potatoes - totally fine, nothing special. \\n\\nSeafood station: \\n\\nTried the crab legs, oysters and the Louisiana shrimp (which was a little piece of bread with shrimp and sauce on). The Louisiana shrimp sauce was very salty, I could not finish it. Also tried the lobster bisque but again, very salty. They also had shrimps and some other food items, but wasn\\'t too impressed with this station either I\\'m afraid. \\n\\nMexican station: \\n\\nIt was definitely nice to get freshly made tacos - I tried pork, chicken and beef. All good and there was plenty of salas to pick from and nice chunky guac, pico de gallo etc. \\n\\nItalian station: \\n\\nPizza, pasta etc. I only tried some cold cuts and cheese. Also tried the cannelloni which was quite good too. I never tried the asian station as I have an allergy to nuts, but my bf compared it to Panda Express and said it was similar in taste. \\n\\nDesert station: \\n\\nSaved the best for last. This was definitely the only highlight of the buffet in my opinion. There was many gelato options - I tried strawberry lychee, hazelnut and toasted marshmallow. Toasted marshmallow was super sweet but fun to try. My boyfriend tried the chocolate souffle made to order and he liked it! I tried the crepe made to order with nutella and banana - so good. Also had cake pop (cherry-flavor, not my favourite), tiramisu, chocolate mousse, key lime tart (FAV!! so good), lemon bar and white chocolate covered strawberries (so good!!!). Also tried the macarons which were quite good as well. \\n\\nSo, dessert was definitely the things on the buffet that I thought held up to the standard of a $75 buffet. Everything else was \"eh\" really. If I had come here during a regular week or weekend, I realise that the price would have not been as high and then maybe it would be worth it. But for $75 I expect a really nice quality buffet, not lukewarm mediocre food.',\n",
       " \"I came to this buffet for dinner on a Tuesday and the price was $55 per person. It was not worth the $55, in my opinion. There were some good food options but highly overrated.

I should have complained but I decided not too because this is my opinion and my thoughts. The king crab is super salty and small amount of meat. The crab claws taste like nothing and the Dungeness crab it was ok. The oyster had too much sand inside.. \\noverall this place is not worth $126 for two.

Tacky as hell; not what you\\'d expecting from a \"fine\" establishment.\\n\\nLamb chops were very good. Other meats including shrimp, prime rib, pork and beef ribs and crab legs were shockingly poor. Crab legs were split vertically for ease of eating but this made them watery and less flavorful.

Loveman\\nCaesars Investor Relations\\nOne Caesars Palace Drive\\nLas Vegas, NV 89109\\n\\nRE: Bacchanal--11/10/12\\n\\n\\nDear Gary--\\n\\nMy son turned 21 on November 9th so we traveled to Vegas and had a very nice experience for the weekend.  On Friday night, we were quite entertained at Pure.  That place is phenomenal--great music, great venue and tremendous energy.  For his birthday, Pure was the real deal.\\n\\nOn Saturday morning, we researched and found that the Bacchanal was the best rated buffet in Vegas so we decided to try and recover from the night before with a good meal.  Your buffet was exceptional in every way.  We particularly liked the Bacchanal Benedict--a very nice twist.  Our server Lilly was also tremendous.  Our group never wanted for service, the mimosas were filled very quickly and the experience overall was a home run.  We liked it so much, we considered returning for dinner and inquired about the Buffet of Buffet's.  Lilly explained the program to us and we were ready to sign up.  On the way out, we grabbed great cookies with the fudge layer.\\n\\nAt the desk on the way out, we presented our ticket to do the upgrade to BOB.  The hostess said it didn't work that way.  We said, all we want to do is give you money and buy dinner for tonight.  She got the supervisor over who sadly was a troll.  We explained that we liked the buffet and wanted to return.  The supervisor told us that this was not possible and we could not buy the BOB in no uncertain terms.  So much so, that we were quite offended.  Clearly, we weren't looking for a deal, we were looking for resolution--that was not possible and we left.\\n\\nI stopped at what looked like a management area and talked to a lady who took my number and said somebody from management would call me.  She said I would be better going to the registration area and speaking to a manager.  So I ambled over there-yes, I was pretty frustrated.  So I talked to Joel who was helping direct people to check in.  He told me that only the ICU manager was working and that Marcus the Food/Beverage General Manager who recently was some other manager would be the person to speak with.  I left my number for Marcus and asked for a call.\\n\\nSo in essence, I requested a call from two different people about the treatment at the Baccanal with my guests and son.  You have a good thing going at your establishment at Caesors.  We travel to Vegas 1-2 times a year and enjoy the get away from our home in Tucson.  You are only as good as your weakest link.  I'm not sure what's more disappointing, the supervisor at the Bacchanal or the fact that no member of management followed up on my concerns.  Remember one thing; I tried to give you more of my money--not sure I'll try next time.\\n\\nSincerely,\",\n",

I saw a Yelp review of the Cosmopolitan Buffet that said there were quite a few vegetarian friendly dishes there.\",\n",
       " \"Overpriced low quality food.  For months I heard my friends tell me to go to The Bacchanel. I went there tonight and to be honest it didn't meet my expectations.  The Asian and Italian sections were simplistic. The Chinese food lacked flavor and it seemed I was eating food from any other China Express or food court restaurant.  The Japanese sushi rolls were not fresh and you could see it was low quality fish/crab. The Italian pizzas and pastas were nothing special. As far as the meats, the sausage was ok, but the lamb was so bad I spit it out (I wasn't the only one).  I did not try the American section as I was already dissapointed. I would definately not recommend you to stop by. I think you can eat much better food for the $126 I spend for two.\",\n",
       " \"I try to go to at least one Vegas buffet a year...and I am continually disappointed. I came her during lunch it was earlier in the day so it wasn't too crowded. The food was mediocre. \\nThe sushi selection was not really a selection. It looked rather sad actually only 4 choices of rolls and no sashimi. The dim sum selection was quite large however the shumai is the only thing worth getting\\n\\nThe seafood selection was not an actual selection. The crab claws hardly had any meat and the oyster shooters were super salty.\\n\\nOverall the desserts are the reason why I gave this place two stars. The pan dan tiramisu and the red velvet whoopie pie were my favorite.\",\n",
       " \"Feast of the gods my a$$! Waited in line for an hour and a half only to get inside and have to wait wait wait at each food line for food that was just Ok. The same goes for the dessert. The ice cream tasted like ice milk, the strawberries were not ripe, the tiramisu was nothing to write home about. \\n\\nNot one thing amazingly delicious or decadent, nothing unique, nothing knock your socks off I have to go back for more of that good. The presentation was nice but the flavor lacked a punch. \\n\\nThe service was good:waiters and waitresses were very polite, our beverage glasses stayed full, one waiter even stood watch over our plates as we went back to try some other foods. \\n\\nWhen u walk in they take your group's picture then later on try to sell it to you for $35. $35?! After the wait we had and the $50 we paid to eat this food that's just one step above golden corral they should've given everyone that damn pic for free. \\n\\nThe buffet at the Bellagio is MUCH better! At the end of our Baccha-not experience we concluded that we should've just gone to our old fav the Bellagio.\",\n",
       " 'The food is 5 stars, the service is 1 star. They have no idea how to handle crowds and I guess its \"more exclusive\" to let everyone else cut if you throw enough money down the hole at this awful casino. The food is amazing but arriving on a Monday to a 90 minute \"wait\" when half the buffet tables are empty is stupid. I\\'m done with Caesars. Goodbye',\n",
       " 'Overrated, over priced and over hyped.\\n\\nAfter a three year hiatus from Vegas and studying a variety of reviews, articles, status updates, tweets, and listening to chatter from those who enjoyed this majestic buffet I left unimpressed. Sure it looks cool, but I\\'m not paying for an architectural tour. \\n\\nPrice point wise it\\'s the highest. It\\'s not top shelf quality and execution. This distinction belongs to Wynn, Wicked Spoon and even Bellagio. It might be worth it if they bring their price down. Additionally, it cost me $26.95 for my four year old.\\n\\nWhen I think of any buffet I\\'m always partial to the carving station. To me, this is fundamental component of every good buffet. It\\'s like when I test a great ice cream place I\\'m not falling for the gimmicks, bells, and whistles. I want to know how your vanilla tastes like. If it\\'s a wedding, I don\\'t care about your photo booth, how was your wedding cake. Well, this carving station fell short. Real short. The prime rib was extremely dry. Lacked salt and any kind of savory flavor. I even asked for an edge piece and it still lacked any depth. The brisket was a little better, but also dry too. The ribs were the best, good smoke ring.\\n\\nMaybe if they didn\\'t bother with the meat and cheese spread they could have put more effort in their \"American\" station. The Mexican station was also disappointing. The carnitas were very dry. The agua frescas were the only redeeming parts of that station.\\n\\nThe Asian stations, the desserts and the seafood station were probably it\\'s best features, but for a bay area native I was not lured by their Asian offerings. If I wanted seafood I would have somewhere else. If they had a dessert buffet option price I would reconsider returning.\\n \\nQuality, not quantity is what\\'s lacking. I won\\'t be endorsing it unless you have money to throw away or want to spend most of your time at the dessert station.',\n",

       " \"O how the mighty have fallen...\\n\\nI remember checking this place out at an Elite Event last year, it was great, food was fresh, service on point, I had no complaints. In fact, I thought it was one of the best buffets in town.\\n\\nFast forward to today, minus the Yelp Elite treatment I got to see the typical consumer experience and I was sorely disappointed. The major issue with the place is the price: $50 bucks, but Ill get to that part later.\\n\\nThe food quality has really dropped off recently. We visited on a Thursday for dinner, and after waiting in like for about 30 min (which I heard is a short wait) We got in, shelled out $200+ for 4 people and went off get some food. Unfortunately, Bacchanal has fallen into the ways of many other buffets in town. Much of the food sat under heating lamps. The once crisp pizzas are now soggy and poorly replenished. The carving station now serves up a 50/50 portion of fat and meat. The carvers give little attention to giving you the best cut. The watermelon/feta cheese dish which I adored is gone (maybe just on the day I went). Souffle station? not open, sushi? a mess. Most of the cheese/meats were gone. Chicken fingers were replaced with dry and over-fried chicken wings. And I still don't know why they don't place ranch/dipping sauces in the vicinity. Not really up to the caliber of what I once experienced. \\n\\nThe service was abysmal. After our initial visit, we had to flag down other servers for refills. We never got any of our condiments, and we watched as the dirty plates piled up on our table. We weren't the only ones, while waiting in the long line for the carving station I saw other diners place their used plates on other tables to clear up space on theirs. Really sad. And speaking of lines, I am almost convinced that the buffet is set-up to maximize the wait for the good stuff. The lines to the carving station and seafood are lonnnng. Expect to wait 15min to get a serving of fatty prime rib or some luke-warm crab. bleh...\\n\\nNow this all brings me to bigger issue: value. At $50 I think this place is outrageous. Keep in mind that they have upped the price from what used to be $40.. and it does not include free drinks! Other buffets in town (IE: The M buffet) at least includes unlimited beer and wine, Bacchanal wants even more $$$. They do at least offer a pretty big wine list. At $50+ a pop you are approaching fine dining prices, places in CP like Mesa Grill will get you a lot more for your money. Better quality food, better experience, and definitely better service. Now don't get me wrong, Bacchanal is a pretty good buffet. It offers up stuff you can't find anywhere else but its simply not worth it. You get a wide selection of average food.\\n\\nCouple of bright spots: \\n\\nThey now serve up mochi woo!\\nStreet taco station is as good as ever!\\nPlace looks amazing, best looking buffet in town.\\nDesert station is on point, every dessert you could want.\\n\\nBut be warned: you will be leaving feeling full, but not satisfied.\",\n",
       " 'This buffet is overrated. You actually need to wait in a line to get to the final waiting line and keep lining up there for an hour. A lot of dishes that are supposed to be warm are not kept that way. Snow crab legs are too slim and tastes like it has just been brought out from the fridge.',\n",
       " \"Every time I go to Vegas I have to eat here because I love the food! But after what happen tonight they will never get my business any more! We are a family of 6, I have 4 kids 8,6,4 and a 7 months old. We got here at 7:30 checked in on the kiosk and was given a wait time of about 2hrs. We decided to go to the food court to feed the kids since they were hungry and wasn't going to wait that long to eat. At 8:06pm I was texted to come back, upon coming back I waited about 40mins more standing in line to pay. Getting to the cashier I told her how many I had in my party, but I was only going to pay for 2 adults because my kids ate already and she said that's fine but if they do eat they'd have to pay and I said of course I was fine with that, she then told me to proceed and let the hostess know the situation. I'm not one to skimp on paying meals for my kids. I told the hostess and she said I'm not sure if we can do that, she then called and asked her manager, and the manager said no and that I'd have to pay for the kids. So I told the hostess to call the manager back, I spoke to the manager and her reasoning was because we'd be taking up seats for 7 ppl, which I only had 6, and there's still people that has a 2hr wait and there might be a party that will be paying for 5 seats. My husband told her, so if it was my wife and I and we had quadruplette babies we'd still be taking up a space for 6 and only paying for 2. She then got flustered and couldn't answer us and started going around in circles. She also went on to tell us that the cashier didn't tell me it was ok, so I confronted the cashier with the manager there and the cashier said yes I told her it would be ok to pay for the adults and the kids can come in. The manger not only doesn't know how to count but she's a liar too! The manager's name is Rebecca by the way!\\nThis is not the first time that this buffet has been not accommodating to families with kids. I've given them a second chance since they remodeled. Before it was bacchanal we came here and my son was just not having a good day and he was crying and the manager had the nerve to ask us to leave after we paid and were seated! \\nThis was the last straw for me. I love the food here, but because of  the horrible customer service today I will never be going back! Sometimes good food, but bad service makes a restaurant horrible!\",\n",
       " 'Worst crab legs buffet for the prize. Website menu shows Alaskan King Crab Legs, I also contacted the place to confirm before I arrived. Specifically asked if they had hot king crab legs buffet and lobster. Was told yes. Arrived to find no lobster and king crab legs unless u have premier membership which was not mentioned. Waiter asked if we wanted drinks so we ordered margarita and he brought us a check. We were not inform ahead of time that we had to pay when other places included in the buffet. Again, employee lie to get customers in and seafood cost and quality is not worth it compare to other places on the strip. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND EVER. Save your money and go some place else for crab legs!! I wish I could post over and over again how much I hated this place . A good example of being cheated in Vegas!!!!!',\n",

       " 'My friends and I went to the Bacchanal Buffet for lunch on a Sunday and we paid at 2:52 and 2:53 according to our receipts. After you pay you enter a second line and wait to be seated. We waited for 20-30 minutes (at least) for a table. This brings our time to 3:13-3:23. \\n\\nWe were enjoying ourselves eating our meal. I did not think the food was the best I ever had but it was good. The food was not bad at all. I was happy but the price at $44.31 was a little steep compared to other buffets in Vegas. At 5:00 (assumption, I never looked) our server (nice lady helping us) says she is done with her shift and Miguel will be helping us. Miguel comes and it becomes very difficult to track Miguel down for refilling our water and our tea. Once we flag him down he states he is busy and will come back. I go and get dessert (some fruit) and come back. Another girl at my table is eating some macaroon cookies and the other two girls are not eating but drinking their tea. Two of us are eating dessert when Miguel (our new server) comes back at 5:24 and points to our receipt and states \"Excuse me, excuse me. Can you read this? What does this say? You have been here for 4 hours.\"  We read what he is pointing to and look at each other. The receipt states \"Please limit your dining experience to two hours.\" We proclaim, \"We have been here for 4 hours!? Seriously??\". We are in dismay and start thinking when we entered the buffet. We realize our receipt has the time we purchased the meal and look at our receipt and it says 2:53 (my friends receipt). We realize it took a good 20-30 minutes to be seated (if not longer). 3:13/3:23-5:24  was how long we were enjoying our dining experience. I am shocked and a little upset. \\n\\nWhen you pay nearly 50 dollars for a meal you expect a good meal. That includes decent customer service. Never have I ever been asked to leave a buffet before. I was not sure if I was more upset about being asked to leave in such a rude way or asking us to leave in general. I look around and see empty tables around us so I am surprised after 2 hours to the DOT, (plus/minus 5-10 minutes), we are asked to leave. I can understand why they have the comment on the receipt. They don\\'t need people spending 4+ hours in there or people not eating taking up space when people are waiting in line and waiting for a table. However, there were open tables and we were only there for 2 hours finishing our dessert and about to leave. I cannot imagine them (the staff) asking any patron to leave for staying two hours while they are still eating. That is another thing that made me upset. I feel if an elderly couple were enjoying their tea and cookies (clearly dessert) nothing would have been said to them. If a family had been enjoying dessert nothing would have been said to them. Four young adults? Another story. These are just my opinions and stray from the facts, I am not sure what they were thinking but clearly they had facts wrong. We had not been dining for 4 hours!\\n\\nMy friend is very upset and asks to speak to the manager immediately. Miguel brings Jamie Radke. My friend starts yelling at Jamie about how rude that was. Clearly it could have been stated in a nicer way if we HAD been eating for 4 hours. She then states that we had not even been dining for 4 hours and being asked to leave was beyond rude and unprofessional. Jamie agrees and agrees and apologies. We are expecting something for our dinner being ruined in return. I think most of us would expect *something*. We expect our NEXT meal to have been free in order to have us come back again. Jamie says she cannot do anything but give us a few drinks. Jamie states Miguel was wrong and out of line. She offers to allow us to stay as long as we want and move us to a different section. She is unsure as to why he asked us to leave. Miguel had been on shift 24 minutes. Someone above him asked him to tell us to leave. Someone screwed up and I blame the assistant manager on duty (Jamie). I highly doubt Miguel knew how long we had been there because he recently started his shift... My friend asks for Jamie\\'s card and a form to file a formal complaint. We are still waiting on the Hotel\\'s response over the incident but I am upset about what happened. There are a ton of buffets in Vegas and I will not be eating at this place again. There are too many incompetent people in positions that should be fired. There are plenty of hard working people out there that could do a better job. Oddly enough, I searched Jamie Radke in the yelp reviews and found 2 more complaints against her.. I do not like when someone/anyone screws up and it gets put on the lowest person in the company (Miguel) to take the blow. It bothers me a lot and people should take responsibility for the people working beneath them. That is their job. Jamie should have taken full responsibility for the incident and not blamed Miguel.',\n",
       " \"Gross. I just visited Bacchanal for the second time and I really think it has gone downhill. We had brunch on Presidents Day weekend so OF COURSE it was more expensive. The service was TERRIBLE. I ate almost an entire plate of food before we were offered drinks. No servers ever came anywhere near our table for like 15 minutes. Also, while we found a few winners, there were several items I tried and couldn't finish because they were so gross. The eggs Benedict is a prime example. It was cold, the English muffin was mushy, and the hollandaise sauce was disgusting. On the other hand, the lobster Benedict was delicious. Go figure... I think was probably our last time trying this buffet.\",\n",

I tried some jalapeño berry gelato and almost gagged. There was no simple vanilla or chocolate or strawberry flavor. In short, while this buffet was not the worst, it is simply not as good as Bellagio. And definitely not worth the 5-hour wait.\",\n",

Then we had to wait another 20 minutes to be seated. \\n\\n2) the hostess asked my wife and I to stand in 3 different places when we finally got to the front of the line.

The cakes and treats were all meh. \\n\\nThe food itself was pretty boring. There's a big selection but none of it was as good as a similar dish at Wynn or wicked spoon.

It took a little over an hour to get in line is what they meant was 1 hour to get in line. So we waited about 20 minutes to be put in another line for a part of four. If you come with a big party apparently they'll let you in before everyone else since most people have smaller parties.  Once you finish the 2nd you pay upfront. There were 4 of us and we payed over $220 for the meal which will seem bad by the time this review is over. Anyway after you pay they put you in another line. The line your put in depends on the amount of people in your party. So we wait in that line for 25 minutes and when we get in we get our food because we were very hungry. Everything was just mediocre and they were understaffed. I had an empty glass of soda for half the meal. The employees had to work very hard nonstop due to not being many of them. The food was not fresh at all and felt as if they were instant. They taste was very bland and they chiefs were not equipped with high quality food to distribute. For the ceviche they would bring plastic tubs out of a fridge and scoop it with a bowl into a display and looked filthy. The dessert area on the other hand was magnificent with all the flavorful desserts and nice ice cream. That itself earned it two stars or else it's not even worth one. Another thing i forgot to mention is that many corners in service were cut and an example for that is the moist towels were dry. I would not recommend to ever come here.

Went at 830am for breakfast and had to wait almost 25 mins to get seated while there were only 3 people ahead of us and yes there were guests with status who got seated before us which is fine, but when there are 50 empty tables or more, there is no need to have a table of two wait for a table to open up. Seat them at a table for 4. Also unless you had status at casino it seemed you could not get a server to bring drinks! Sat at table 20 more minutes before we gave up and went to buffet to get food. Very poorly managed and we will never be back. I live near nyc and eat there often and this type of hype for this buffet does not even compare to the service you receive at a food cart in NYC. For 30 bucks each for breakfast we were very disappointed and had much better breakfast else ware. Avoid at all costs !',\n",
       " \"I left this place very disappointed. I always wanted to try buffet in vegas, and based on the reviews on yelp, I decided to try this place. I went for dinner on a saturday night, and only waited for an hr to be seated. Maybe my expectation was too high, but food was not that good. Now with tip, my friend and i paid $70 each. With that and little more, i could've gone to a fancier restaurant and left full and satisfied. People didn't know where to form a line, since the meat section and seafood section were next to each other. People cut in front of me, someone even poured gravy on my plate. There were so many people working there, but nobody bothered to control the place. I ended up eating a piece of prime rib, 2 crab legs, and some noodle. The line for seafood section was so long i gave up and ate noodle, it was very expensive noodle for sure. Will i ever come back? Probably not. Will i recommend this place? No again. The only good thing was the lady walking around to refill drinks, it seemed like she was only one actually working there.\",\n",
       " \"Customer service is terrible. Group of 8 and they had a disaster of a time sitting us and the hostess was terrible and rude. Plus they kept coming back asking for more money. Food is okay but not worth the $70+... oh yeah, and that's the price without alcohol. Cesar's is great but your money can be much better spent elsewhere in terms of food.\",\n",
       " \"I will never eat here again. After waiting nearly two hours for a highly-acclaimed meal, reputed to be the best Las Vegas high-end buffet and paying nearly $60/person, we were disappointed by food that wasn't fresh and poor service. The king crab on the seafood line was tasteless, the oysters were on the way to rotten with a strong fishy taste, the tuna poke bolls were dried almost to the point of being jerky and the wait staff kept our drinks empty and our table cluttered. I get better food and service at the $10 Chinese buffets in Dallas. Very disappointed.  Edit: I bumped the review to 2 stars because dessert was good. Still won't be back.\",\n",

Crawfishes are peppery! Clams are blend! Oysters are NOT fresh!\\n\\nSushi is hard.\\n\\nI think the only good items were corns & congee.\\n\\nAgain not worth $52.99!',\n",
       " \"This was the first buffet I ever had in Vegas, so my gf and I wanted to try it out for lunch. You stand in line to pay first ($44 person). That line took at least 10 minutes. Then you go in another line to be seated. There are 4 different lines. One is VIP, 1-2 people, 3-5 people and large group line. We waited in line (1-2 people line) 30-45 minutes! Finally was seated and put in our drink order. The buffet had a good variety and another room around the corner with food. The food was good, but not out of this world good. Do not come here starving because you might actually die from starvation while waiting in line!  I'll probably not come here again and just try another place. You also have a 2 hour time limit. Not sure if that's the norm here in Vegas.\",\n",

PLEASE read on:\\n\\nWe were waiting in the general line, and since i am 6 months pregnant and was very hungry, my husband asked the cashiers on the VIP side if we can pay extra to skip the line, the lady proceeded to tell him sure come over here and wait. So he pulled me out of line and we stood in the express line. After waiting a while we asked her if we can pay already, since the other general line was already moving along. She said \"i have to take the vips first\" mind you there were hardly any people walking up on the VIP side, we asked again a few minutes later since the general line was moving and we could already have been closer, she responded ill get my manager. We said fine!\\n\\nManager comes over and we explained the situation, and that we could have just stayed in the general line and saved time and hassle. She apologized and asked us to go ahead and pay, SO another cashier takes us and although we didn\\'t pay the extra charge (why should we when we could have been there already at general line) but she did not ask us our name for the party on the ticket.\\nAnd so she took it upon herself to type on the reciept that our party name was \"ANGRY\"!!!! SERIOUSLY WE WERE LIVID!\\nOur entire interaction was calm and honest we just said it like it was, never were we angry, regardless of the fact what kind of person types the customer\\'s name as ANGRY!??? \\nDid i mention i am 6 months pregnant!? this discriminatory action and unprofessional customer service is totally unacceptable. This is ceasars palace?? Ha! didnt feel like it!\\n\\nThe manager came over and when we showed her the reciept she was embarrased turned red and appologized continuously. She reveresed the charge and gave me a complaint form to fill out. She said someone will contact us about the incident in a couple days, its been over two weeks now and no one has called us!!! so this is the review they get!!! and i will continue to spread this rediculous action we experienced at supposedly the nicest Buffet in vegas people spend hundreds on!!??? i think not!',\n",
       " 'The ambiance, hip-fine dining. The service, helpful and friendly. Those are about the only pros of this \"top rated\" Las Vegas buffet. The first thing that caught my eye upon paying at the cashier was the vast amount of empty tables. Now this wouldn\\'t have been a problem had it not been a literal hour wait. Sacrificing the customers needs in order to make it easier on service? Questionable. The most important part though, for a 60 dollar dinner would be the food. One would think they would focus on this factor a bit more but every single item available was either completely tasteless or overly spiced. How do you justify a 60 dollar meal with cardboard food of low quality. Is your food cost really worth sacrificing quality? I truly wish they would focus more on customer needs and food quality. \\n\\nTldr; wanna feel fancy and eat low quality food for fine dining prices? Bachannal is the place for you.',\n",
       " 'Wicked spoon is by far by favorite Vegas buffet, but after reading reviews about how it\\'s \"fallen off\" we decided to try Cesar\\'s. It\\'s the only decent buffet I haven\\'t been to. Standing in line eagerly, even after we heard it\\'d be a 45 minute wait. I was excited, and hungry! Buffets are my absolute favorite, I get bored easily, so I usually opt for sushi or tapas so I can try a few things at once. \\n\\nFinally when we were seated the excitement continued, oooh Asian station, ahh seafood! Ramen and pho?? I decided to head for the Asian station first, which had some \" sushi \" and dim sum. The sushi immediately made my stomach turn and all of a sudden my hunger had vanished. The salmon was a burnt orange color.. On the verge of turning brown and the tuna just looked rotten. I was quite shocked as I saw alot of people still opting for the sushi..but I looked again and realized everyone I saw was non asian. Hmph, I decided to steer clear - I\\'ve had food poisoning once and it\\'s definitely no fun. \\n\\nHad some dim sum which was really authentic - ( up to par with elite) The fresh shrimp was good, The king crab legs were decent, but I had a few frozen pieces which were a huge turn off. I understand that happens at Asian buffets, but c\\'mon! Seriously Cesar\\'s?! \\n\\nThe prime rib line was ridiculous, stood in line for another 20 minutes. But I figured hey, this must be their best dish - but no :( my slice was far too overcooked, and I don\\'t know who said it\\'s better than Lawrys, but they\\'re smoking crack. \\n\\nThe ramen and pho were surprisingly not bad. Not the best I\\'ve ever had but actually decent. Btw they don\\'t have hoison for the pho, only sirracha.\\n\\nThe sliders looked ridiculously good oozing with cheese, but yet again overcooked. If you like your patty well done - this dish is for you. All in all my favorites were the juice section & dessert. The juice selection had fresh cucumber, tomato, grapefruit and a few others. the cucumber tasted so fresh, lovely after a night of drinking vegas. The dessert section had an amazing  lava cake. Not overly sweet, just perfect. I was quite sad they had no macarons though :( they are only made for dinner. They had a variety of gelato flavors I\\'ve never heard of, so that was cool. Try thai tea :) \\n\\nAlso - maybe this buffet was better once upon a time, because half of the dishes in the pictures were nonexsistent when I went. I probably won\\'t be returning , for $110 after tax and tip for a party of two - the juice and dessert weren\\'t THAT good. I\\'d rather go to wicked spoon or the buffet at m resort.',\n",

The VIP treatment consists of unclearly marked lines where you wait and wait only to be told by unsmiling surly staff that you are in the wrong line so go back to square one. For the prices charged as compared to other Vegas buffets you would expect the seafood selection would at least have crab legs for breakfast or lunch but not here.

       " 'After hearing really good news about this buffet, my friends and I decided to close out our Vegas trip with a visit to \"the buffets of all buffets\" Vegas had to offer. Lets just say waiting until our last night in Vegas was a great decision.\\n\\nThe wait time wasn\\'t too bad, a total of 80mins.\\n\\nThere were a lot of uncommon buffet options (Bone Marrow, Pork stuffed chicken wings, etc). For some odd reason there wasn\\'t fried chicken so that was a let down.\\n\\nAnd for the most part it was enjoyable, but in no way did it live up to the hype or the price. \\n\\nThe worst part of this experience was the food poisoning I got the next morning and continue to feel 2 days after. It\\'s not fun traveling back to the east coast on a 5 hour flight when you need to use the restroom every few minutes. I think it was the really, really salty crab legs they serve. \\n\\nAnyways, eating at buffets are always risky, so if you\\'re feeling Lucky go head and feast at The Bacchanal. \\n\\nT\\'s and P\\'s for my fiery butt hole.

Walked in the place was still a bit packed so I was like ok the food should be good still...\\n\\nFinally picked up a plate started walking around and seriously.... food looked like they've been sitting there for hours! Asian section sucked worst har gow ever, sushi section was small and looked like cheap cheap sushi and the taste reflected it. Noodle bar was decent ramen and pho were super salty but actually had flavor. \\n\\nOysters were disgusting i even asked if she could bring out new ones cause the ones they had out looked like dry oysters. It was nasty... I spat it out. Crab legs were the most decent to be honest and some desserts. Our waiter didn't even shop up after cause it was near closing time... didn't really see him since he got us the first glass of water. \\n\\nMy first Vegas meal was such a disappointment, I wouldn't of paid even $10 for this. Maybe the food would taste better if it was earlier? Well I also based this review on taste as well. Nothing special, I would go somewhere else for $60 a person! Meh.\",\n",
       " \"Biggest disappointment on our entire trip. Everything is so salty and/or has less than stellar taste. Some things were downright bad. The saddest thing was the quality of the seafood. I've had better at a Golden Corral ( and I don't like Golden Corral) . Service also took a long time to refill our empty drinks. Then the drink machine for my tea broke so I went most of the meal without a beverage. Only highlight: the desserts are pretty. At $56 per person, we definitely had buyer's remorse.\",\n",
       " \"The buffet was better in 2014 than today. I went there twice recently. I expect to be blown away for the price, which is reasonable given the quality and quantity of food. I wasn't blown away this time. The cold seafood appetizers aren't as good as I remembered in the past. The cold shrimp and cocktail sauce, however, are still terrific. They didn't have the risotto in the Italian station like they did before. Why not? It used to be so good! The pork belly with polenta and balsamic was terrific, but they don't offer it consistently. Why not? The sushi dishes are meh, but the duck is outstanding. Be sure to try the outstanding juices at the Mexican station. The dessert station, at least, is consistent. Go for the made-to-order crepes. I also like the strawberry-flavored marshmallows and the creme brulee. The service, at least, is still excellent. Take care of your servers!\",\n",
       " 'Long review again: see the TLDR plus full rating in the updated version that I\\'ll post tomorrow. This is mostly just about the food.\\n\\nI came at 10ish on Christmas Eve and we were seated immediately. Food & drink options: They had a juice bar that they were cleaning up... they replaced it with a salsa bar but before they did I got some green juice and watermelon juice. They had a nice meat bar where they served cuts of various sausages, thick cut bacon, and brisket. Further down the line I picked up some hash browns, mac and cheese, eggs benedict, \"lobster\" benedict, crab cakes, fried chicken and waffles, fingerling potatoes, and some mini pancakes. They had a cheese bar with an impressive amount of accoutrements... but a disappointing amount of charcuterie and cheese. I also tried a deviled egg and a watermelon dish. They also had a seafood bar, I had a handful of shrimp, a few oysters, and crab legs. Lobsters came out towards the end of my meal. I saw it on a few diner\\'s plates so I asked two staff members where I could find it. The first said lobster wasn\\'t being served but the second person got it right. The line wrapped around the whole back room and it took a while for everyone to be served. Some people were taking 5-6 of them at once... Anyways, everything else seemed like typical stir fried buffet fare. I like the idea of small plates but some of those plates are f***ing hot. NASA\\'s guidelines to tolerance to hot temperatures before skin damage occurs are set between 110°-112°F and I\\'m pretty sure most of those plates exceeded that. My brother said they provide little silicone handles that you can use but I didn\\'t see a single one while I was there. So you\\'re forced to pile them onto the plates... and you can only fit about 3-4 of them on one plate.\\n\\nThe food: The green was alright but not sweet enough for my tastes. So pretty much, not sweetened at all. It tasted of cucumbers and unidentified greens. The watermelon juice was alright. The sausages were good, the thick cut bacon... not so much. The brisket was decent, tender and slightly smoky in flavor but a bit of it was hard and tough to chew. The hash browns and mac and cheese were okay. The eggs benedict was pretty good and flavorful. The \"lobster\" benedict was essentially the same just with a slight sprinkle of lobster. It tasted no different from the regular eggs benedict. The crab cakes were one of my favorite dishes here but after a few of them, you get kind of tired of the taste. I especially liked the asparagus shoot garnish. It provided a nice crunchy texture. The fried chicken tasted like nothing special and felt like it could have been from Popeyes or KFC. People rave about the fingerling potatoes but they didn\\'t taste like anything special and were actually a bit tough to chew. Some hurt my teeth when I bit into them. The mini pancakes were a waste of time. A lot of these items I could say tasted decent but I had to remind myself that I was at a $60 buffet and questioned myself why I was wasting precious stomach space on only average tasting food. The cheese bar had anchovies, guava jam, nuts, and honey. There were essentially two cheeses: one was crusted with some herb, the other the same thing without the herb, and a brie (I believe it was president, just a generic brand). The prosciutto was cut too thick and had been sitting out for too long and was dry and hard. The deviled egg I tried looked good but tasted disgusting. It was bitter for some reason and tasted off. The watermelon just tasted like a cube of watermelon sprinkled with Tajín. The shrimp was good but the oysters... not so much. The oysters were frozen and tasted like they had gone bad and were super briney. Disgusting. Props to them having real (and potent) horseradish. My parents said the crab legs were lacking. The lobster was alright, a bit tough and chewy but the flavor was alright. I wish this had come out a bit earlier and I would have eaten a lot more of it.\\n\\nI\\'ve heard a lot of good things about their dessert but I wasn\\'t feeling it. I tried their eggnogg crème brule, chocolate peppermint cheesecake, mini egg tarts, tiramisu, cheesecake, rice pudding with passion fruit foam, and gelato. The holiday desserts were disgusting. They had an overwhelmingly artificial flavor. The mini egg tarts were dry and not that great but hey at least they\\'re cute and make for a good picture. The cheesecake was the same. nice presentation, not memorable in taste. rice pudding was also nothing special and the foam was overly tart. The gelato was overly flavored and tasted like soap / perfume. The tiramisu was the only thing I enjoyed. It was deliciously moist and heavy on the coffee / liqueur flavor. Pretty bitter but it was still enjoyable. Such a shame I wasn\\'t able to try the crepes. I\\'m not paying $60 again just to try them.',\n",
       " \"Hyped up beyond reason. The food was ok, but nothing special. The only saving grace was that the crab was amazing. The shell fish in general was good too. Everything else was pretty average. The fish was over cooked, the chicken was dry, the coffee was cold, the desserts was hit and miss. The crepes are good, the creme brûlée was delicious, the macaroons were ok too. A lot of the cakes and cupcakes were too dry. \\n\\nThe main reason I'm giving this 2 stars though was the poor service. The wait took forever, which was expected I guess for such a popular buffet. But then they made us pay before even entering, including the tip! I gave the tip of course, expecting the service to be at least ok given the reviews. But the servers take forever to clear empty plates off the table. They seem to be ignoring my table in general. It took a lot of effort just to flag down someone to get more drinks. And as I mentioned, the coffee came cold. \\n\\nI'm really disappointed with the entire experience. And I'm really regretting even tipping at all considering we got basically no service. For somewhere with such a high rating and apparently consistently great reviews, it's really not worth the money I paid for it.\",\n",
       " \"Very disappointed!\\n\\nThe food was OK, not really any better than  Bellagio, Wynn, or Cosmopolitans Wicked Spoon in my opinion.\\n\\nThe low rating is for the wait times and setup of the buffet.  There was a two hour wait in line to get in.  We choose to do the express line for an extra $15 each.  Once inside the lines continued.\\n\\nTo get to the seafood or the meat selections you had to wait in 20-30 minute lines.  You would walk to other parts of the buffet and it would be empty.\\n\\nMany of the selections are on individual plates or in baskets, this makes it difficult to carry your food as the plates slide round.  It is also cumbersome when you have to wait in long lines for your food.  \\n\\nI also noticed while making a salad that the counters were so low that I could not get around the sneeze guard to get to toppings in the back without having to contort myself.  I am 5'9 so not overly tall.\\n\\nI noticed that people were filling multiple plates because the lines were so long that to go back for seconds you would have to wait in line all over again.\\n\\nCesar's really needs to rethink this $50 million dollar mess, until then, don't waste your time.\",\n",

Again food is good but you also pay for good service and a wonderful time and having people upset over tip issues takes away from the experience.  If service merits 18% at buffet, no one would have cared.   But service not that great.  Probably will not return.

I liked the crab legs that were in the hot water the most. Even though they were sliced open for us, they didn't give you enough meat per slice.  I would have preferred they just cracked it open but not slice it completely in half.  That was you get the full meat per leg section.  I also tried the bloody mary oyster shots.  I wouldn't recommend this at all.  Once you get past the bloody mary taste, it gets worse from there.  The crawfish had no flavor and the mussels were dry.\\nThe sushi portion of this buffet is something you should skip.

       " 'After reading several reviews of Caesars\\' new Bacchanal Buffet, I was excited to give it a try, but was tremendously disappointed. \\n\\nFirst, the service. Our wait in the \"regular\" line at 11:30 this morning was around 30 minutes. Normally, I\\'d have no problem with that, but when we did pay and were shown to our table, I noticed that only about 1/3 of the tables were full. Other reviewers have pointed this same phenomenon out, so I can only conclude that CP is trying to make their high-rollers feel more \"special\", or that they\\'d like people to pony up the extra $15 to jump the line, or that, if all tables were full, the chefs at the food stations would be unable to keep up. \\n\\nAbout that table: it was either too high, or my chair was too low. I still can\\'t decide which, but either way, it was uncomfortable. My chair also straddled a carpet/ marble divide, with the back legs on marble and the front on carpet  not a big deal at a normal restaurant, but at a buffet, this wasn\\'t ideal. \\n\\nI would, in fact, like to meet the idiot that designed the room. First, it\\'s a clear rip-off of the design at Aria\\'s buffet. (I did enjoy the light fixtures on the pillars outside the buffet). Second, the layout was confusing and somewhat claustrophobic, with the Asian area tucked into an odd dead-end. The stations where food was being prepared to order forced the lines of people waiting to block other areas. And the sneeze-guards were way too low, making it nearly impossible to reach food towards the rear. \\n\\nOn to the food: there isn\\'t much special here that can\\'t be found at Aria, Wicked Spoon, or Wynn (my favorite). The carved meats looked rather greasy, and the whole roasted chickens were shriveled and pathetic-looking. The sushi selection was decent, but if you\\'re a shellfish lover, you\\'re better off at the Aria or perhaps the Bellagio. The Mexican station was unstaffed--I\\'d been looking forward to a fresh-made tortilla, but oh well. The quality overall was good, but not great, and certainly not worthy of the price they\\'re asking. \\n\\nWe ended up leaving after one plate--it was that bad. I expressed my displeasure to manager type on my way out, but she could barely say \"I\\'m sorry\". If you\\'re looking for a great buffet on the strip, and willing to pay these prices, head for the Wynn, Aria, or Wicked Spoon--but avoid the Bacchanal.',\n",
       " \"You know what I must say I am disappointed - I had very high expectations based on what people say and based on the price they charge. The food was OK nothing to make you say wow this is the best buffet in Vegas. We love meat and it was again just OK - I had much better beef ribs in my life and much better sides to go with it. I guess it is all about the seafood and since I am not a huge fan maybe I didn't see the value \\n\\nNot coming back\",\n",
       " \"If I wanted something this rude, tacky, and expensive I'd spend Christmas with my dad's ex-wife.\\nWaited through a rather short, but painfully slow line during off-hours on a weekday.

She tried to sell me 2 tickets for $120 with no explanation of drinks, obscene pleasures, or anything else to explain the exorbitance.  Ahead of me, I could see yet more inexplicably slow lines.  (It's a buffet, not a rock concert!) So I left.\\n\\nFYI, no buffet with stupidly long lines can be considered fine dining under any circumstances and no endangered shellfish on ice or oversized plaster busts could make these people worth tolerating.\",\n",
       " \"The food that was supposed to be hot was cold. For the buffet to be so large the selection of food was meh. We went for breakfast which they call brunch because they offer breakfast and lunch. The place is sprawling but the hostess didn't tell us there was an additional place for deserts which we saw as we were leaving. The cost was almost double what we paid for at the Wynn the previous day, whose buffet quality and selection was phenomenal! This place might be best for dinner but definitely not for brunch.\",\n",
       " 'Not worth the $55 per person which we paid last night.  For kids under 10, it\\'s half price, $35 I believe.  As some other reviews indicated, I concur that it\\'s not worth waiting close to an hour which we did.  Supposedly, a text will be sent once you get a ticket (kind of like the fastpass system at Disneyland), but as the receptionist explained, everybody showed up with tickets a little earlier than they were supposed to, so she had \"no time\" to text people.  Of course, it might have been that we showed up around 6PM on the Saturday prior to Xmas.\\n\\nI\\'m not much of a seafood eater, so I was able to avoid another line waiting for seafood once I made it past the initial line to pay, and then the secondary line to wait to be seated.  However, even at the carved meats section, there was another line.  Just out of principle, I refused to stand in line, but my daughters and wife were kind enough to do so for me, while they were getting stuff they wanted to eat.\\n\\nSo I ate from the Chinese/Asian section where there wasn\\'t much waiting.  They did have ginger ale to drink, and the mango juice from the Mexican/Latino section was great.  The dessert section was awesome too, but that\\'s really the only thing that impressed me.\\n\\nSo if you basically only eat cooked land animals and like dessert, paying $55 is probably not worth it.  And as far as the \"fastpass\" system is concerned, I think everybody gets a ticket now, so it\\'s not exactly like an advantage.',\n",

Maybe it was the customers in line because I saw tons of workers in the preparation area.  Also, the seating in the restaurant was super cramped with very few aisle ways to get around.  Seemed like Caesars does care about the people's experience once the get inside the restaurant.  I paid $50+ for this!!  \\n\\nPositives:  I will say there was only 1 or 2 people in line when getting the hot crab legs so the wait was minimal if not quite fast.  The crab legs were cut in half making it super easy to eat, but the legs were small though.  there were no lines/minimal people at the salad and Asian food area.  I rarely eat desserts but my wife said the desserts were excellent.  I will say the lady taking care of our table was super.  She did a great job keeping our table clear and was proactive in refilling our drinks and giving us warm towelettes, almost anticipating our every move.\\n\\nHaving to stand in line for so long definitely impacted how I viewed the food.  I was alright.  Nothing special.  \\n\\nI guess people want to get their money's worth and skip everything but the seafood and carved meat.  I've seen good review about this place but based on my experience, my family and I will not be back.\",\n",

They made the dining tables far away from the food stations so it's actually quite a walk every time you pick up your food. After a few round, you probably will lose the will to walk any longer..... The worst part is customer care. 1) there was one group with a kid with ALS (or something like that). They still let the group endure the long wait - c'mon!!... 2) a foreign tourist couldn't speak English well and could only point her finger to the flavor of the ice cream she wanted. The person behind the counter literally got mad, took off her gloves, rolled her eyes, and turned away - the other worker at the station had to come and serve the customer. Absolutely horrifying.

She said the price changed a few days ago. Well, they should have put up a sign or something, how was I to know that?! the 37.00 was still plastered all over the website! I figured FINE, we already waited 2 hours, we might as well.  I asked for a party of 8, and she said they couldnt do more than 4 per table!! I was in shock! I mean i knew that they were busy, but one of the tings I loved about this buffet when I was there the last time was the big huge round tables they had to accommodate large groups! Right then and there I asked to speak with a supervisor, and even she was rude.  She said, and i quote , \"Maam, you can clearly see were busy, we cant take big parties on one table.\" I told her Id be willing to wait, and she told me it was going to be \"Another 2 hours\" I was upset, so I just took it and said fine, give us 2 separate tables.\\n\\nSo we get to our table, and get this. they sit us near 4 EMPTY huge tables that seat a part of 8!!!!!

Just the line alone to get to the food was ridiculous!!! I waited for 15 in just for crab legs..... when I went to the asian section to get the roasted duck that I wanted, it was COMPLETELY empty, and had to wait for that too.... and a lot of the stuff they used to have when I first went there was GONE.\\n\\nOverall, $44 for a buffet? Bad Service? Not enough food? Long waits? SOOOOO OVERRATED! I wont ever go back, I can get way better food for $44 and wayyy better service and not have to wait as long.

I tried the beef brisket but it was so salty I could only eat but a couple bites. I tried a few of the Asian dishes and they were ok. I did like the fresh juices. That was new to see that they offered carrot and cucumber juice. The mimosas were flowing.

       " 'This my 4th time eating here and this will be my last.  At $54 per person, it\\'s over priced period. \\n\\nEach trip has seen the food quality, quality control drop drastically and cutting corners with cheaper ingredients such as noodles for their soup.   No longer fresh udon but the cheap noodles that beak apart and lack flavor and texture. \\n\\nCrab legs - cut and boiled and now too salty and mushy.  Used to be served whole.  Cut crab legs are messy to eat and lose flavor.   \\n\\nDuck - slimy and oily. \\n\\nSalmon - no flavor\\n\\nOysters - yuck.  Too big and too slimy.   No longer fresh, these are frozen and low quality.    \\n\\nHere is the problem, The buffet when it was new, was able to turn the food easier because all the menu items were still novelty to new customers.   Now that the buffet has been around for years, customers are repeat and the novelty has worn off.   Return customers know what they want to eat and those are mostly the \"staple\" buffet items like crab legs.   They no longer eat the novelty menu items and the result is they sit and get old and no longer fresh.   They have too many items to prepare that the result is none of them are that good anymore.   They need to reel it in, cut items that no one eats (meal acceptability can determine that) and make the staple items outstanding.   \\n\\nIt\\'s really too bad because this used to be the best buffet around.  Now it\\'s just a subpar quality buffet with way too many choices.

       " 'Simply put.  This is probably the most impressive buffet I have ever been to.  \\n**scroll to bottom if you would like to to see why this 5 star buffet is only 2 stars**\\n\\nI know Vegas is known for their buffets, and this is the only one I\\'ve been to there, so I\\'m not sure how it stacks up to the others, but all I can say is wow.\\n\\nYes, it was big.  Huge.  Over the top.  \\n\\nTo me, the best feature of this buffet is the presentation/delivery.  Most the food comes in separate dishes.  Like, for example, if you want a piece of lasagna, you don\\'t scoop it out of a trough.... there is a little cast iron skillet with an individual serving you grab.\\n\\nWhats that, you want calamari?  There is a cute little fry basket with calamari in it, just for you.\\n\\nSure, there were some items that still were served trough style, but there were a lot of individualized portions of food that really escalated their buffet game.  It ensured you got the food the way it was intended to be served.  For example, if they were serving something with cheese on top..... if served trough style, some cheese loving behemoth could come through and steal all the cheese off the top and take little of the rest... leaving everyone else getting the entree with no cheese on top.  With these little skillets and baskets and bowls for each person, you can ensure you are getting the food it was meant to be served.\\n\\n**So why 5 stars?  Here are my reasons.**\\n--Sushi was not good.  At all.  In fact, none of the asian food I had was very good.\\n--Crab legs were served Cold on Ice... unless you request them to get heated up.  I asked the crab chef if I could have hot legs, and he said he just put some on top (of the ice) so they would be hot..... guess what, they were cold.  and the lines are so long, its not like I could just get right back in there and request hot ones again.  This pissed me off.\\n--they didn\\'t have prime rib, or any high quality (beef) steaks for that matter.  the meat carver said they were out.. not sure if they ran out, or don\\'t normally have it... but he said, \"were out of that tonight\"\\n--lamb was underseasoned and overcooked.  I\\'m talking well done.\\n--plates would pile up and nobody was clearing them.  Both the gf and I as well as another table were stacking plates on an adjacent table because there wasn\\'t anyone clearing our table until just before we left.  We did get water refills, though, ironically.\\n--they want you to put in a tip BEFORE the meal.  What??  Maybe that\\'s why our plates didn\\'t get cleared.  I guess the wait staff figures their tips are already in the bag.\\n--long wait to get in... BUT for an extra $15 you can get in a VIP line.  What a crock of shit!  Want an easy way to find out whose shit doesn\\'t stink in Vegas??  go stand outside the Bacchannal and see who is standing in the express line.  We had this group of asshats in front of use whose noses were so high in the air they were breathing a different kind of oxygen.  The whole time we were standing in line they were bitching uncontrollably about the line and how they were going to take care of it, like rotten children.  So... after literally like 15-20 minutes of listening to how much better they were than the commoners in the regular line, their dumb-asses eventually figured out how to upgrade to the express line.  Thank God.  I guess maybe it does serve a purpose after all.  My magic moment is when we waited in the regular line like everyone else, and ended up getting seated less than 5 minutes after \"team asshat\".\\n\\nWith all that being said, it was still an impressive buffet to see once...  Flashy, but I wouldn\\'t go again.  I\\'d rather take my $100 and put it towards a nice dinner with higher attention to quality and detail.',\n",

I went to the kiosk to \"put our name in\" and it said to come back at 9pm.  We got in the line that wasn\\'t moving and the host lady came through the line looking at everyone\\'s ticket.  When she got to us she told us to get out of line and come back at 9pm.  That doesn\\'t make sense because by the time we would pay it would have been at least 9pm.  AND the couple in front us had a ticket that said 8:55pm.  So she asked us to get out of line when the people in front of us has a ticket with a 5 minute difference but they were ok.  The lady was so rude, she was short, older, with short gray hair.  We were so disgusted by her rudeness that we left and didn\\'t even eat there.  When you are asking people to pay almost $60 for a buffet you should at least treat them nicely.',\n",

From the time we arrived till the   time we seated we were greeted by a girl at end of the line , a cashier , an employee who showed us to our table and our waiteress. None of them telling us the buffet was closing at 10pm.  They still had a lot of food when we started eating.  Food was great,  fresh. As soon as we were about to go get more food around 10:40pm,  we found out all the food was gone,  all disappeared,  all stations cleaned up,  the only food left were some desserts,  however only about half of selections left. I know we came in at late time, but NOBODY gave us any kitchen last call notice.  We would only need 5 min heads up time to get the food if they could kindly remind us. However it didn't happened. Our waitress didn't tell us, none of the employee did.  We ended up have to take whatever left in desserts to finish our $55 per person meal.  \\nI think it is ridiculous, so I talked to an employee at the cashier,  she asked if the girl at the entrace told me about the kitchen closing time,  I said no.  She asked how about the waitress,  I said no.  So she went find her manager.  A few minutes,  the manager came and asked me the same questions. He (and none of the employees) didn't apologize for the bad service,  he only said he would reflect the incident to the management. He did ask if he could get any food we wanted.At that moment we were eating the desserts and we were so upset,  we just finished up and left.  I wasn't expecting to get my $ back or any free meals,  but to be honest that is not the service I would expect at a luxury hotel casino buffet. Very disappointed and I would never go back to Caesar Palace buffet again.\",\n",

Because the wait was 2 hours, we decided to spring for the additional $25 per person to go through the Express Lane.  We still had to wait about 20 minutes for our table.  Once we were seated, hubby and I went through the buffet line to see if anything caught our eye.  Nothing really stood out besides the juice bar so we started with the seafood.  The seafood starts with some hot entrees such as fish, lobster ravioli, paella, clams and then moves into cold items cerviche, oyster shooters, and thai noodle salad and finally the stone crab claws, shrimp, and king crab legs.  For how much we paid, you would think they would be constantly replenishing not only the food but also the condiments.  Not true.  There was no clarified butter or cocktail sauce when we got to these items.  Didn't like that the crab legs were cold, but if you go to the Italian food section, they have hot crab legs there, which is what I did.  Hubby enjoyed the street tacos but there weren't many other offerings in the Mexican food station.  Tried the old standards of prime rib, mashed potatoes.  Wanted some brisket but they had run out.  Honestly, don't know how you can mess up prime rib and mashed potatoes but the prime rib was tough and the mashed potatoes were pasty, almost as if they were boxed.  Very disappointing.  \\n\\nWanted to try something from the Italian food station, but all they had out were two types of pasta, meatballs, and one pizza.  Really, the pizza area had four empty platters, every time I came back, there was only one pizza out and the cold cuts area was always empty.  Tried the cold cuts twice and each time they hadn't replenished the food.  The worst food was the Chinese food station.  Tried the dim sum - they have the usual shiu mai, har gow, and soup dumplings.  The wrappers on all of these were so thick, not worth even eating.  The spicy stir fried eggplant was not cooked through and the black bean crab had been sitting around for a while.  The peking duck was very greasy.\\n\\nThought they could redeem themselves with the desserts so I decided to try a little of everything, unfortunately met the same problem, very little selection as they hadn't restocked.  I tried the oreo cookie mousse (pretty good), blood orange cream puff (don't try it), flan (nah), crème brulee (best out of everything), molten lava cake (very dry and not molten), cheesecake (skip it), and various gelatos (that was yummy).\\n\\nOverall, the hype was not justified.  Based on the food we had and their inability to even keep the stations stocked, we won't be returning.  It was just a big, overpriced, disappointment.\",\n",
       " \"I came here after Christmas. There was a $48 brunch price because they considered December the 27th a holiday. The inflated price was nowhere to be posted and you are only notified after waiting in this long line and reaching the pay station. Talk about sneaky and greedy! 2 hour time limit for food? Heck no say it isn't so! There was plenty of basic starchy foods such as pizza, pasta, fries, onion rings, waffle, noodles, rice. I skipped the starches. I tried ha gao, cha sui, cha sui ribs, brisket, prime rib, cheesy broccoli, tater tots, and onion rings. The brisket was really good and all else was meh.. The dessert station looked uninteresting. I tried the chocolate pecan pie and a chocolate chip cookie. The nuts in the pecan pie were stale. Yuck! The chocolate chip cookie was good, it had chocolate in the center which was a very nice touch. Would I eat here again? Definitely not for $48, maybe if it were $20.\",\n",

You really had to scrape it off!\\n-The \"fresh\" juices tasted watered down and had no sign of pulp to indicate they were fresh\\n-prime rib and sausage from the carving station were the best items\\n\\nMost disappointing of all was the service.

       " 'My wife got food poisoning from eating at the buffet.  July 1, my friend treated us to lunch at the Bacchanal Buffet, it was very crowded both waiting in line and in-side the eating area.  The lines waiting to get to the food items were long. The noise level in the eating area was very loud and the bussers were slow to pickup and clean vacated tables. \\nI got a prime rib and other food items that I wanted to taste.  I was surprised by the poor quality of the prime rib, the meat was tough and hard to chew, I had better at other buffets in Las Vegas. My wife got food items she wanted to taste.  Her food choices were different from mine.  Besides the her regular choices she wanted to try the Asian food area and liked the steamed rice wrap and commented that it was tasty.\\nLater that night she had the runs and vomiting which continued for the next couple days.  We tried to figure out how and where she got sick.  We did not eat anywhere else except at the Bacchanal Buffet.  We narrowed it down to the Asian food area and possibly the steamed rice wrap. She went to her doctor who confirmed by blood test she had food poisoning.  \\nFrom my personal experience and my wife getting food poisoning we will not go back to that place because of the inadequate quality management of the food they serve, the poor service, and the over crowding of the eating area.',\n",

And I could understand it if they were crowded or something, but we waited for over an hour while we could clearly see that all of the tables were not full inside. I knew about this place and that the wait was unusually long, but it's totally different hearing that the wait will be long and then actually having to stand there and wait.\\n\\nWe had a show to go to at 7 so we got there at 4:30 to check in for dinner. When we got there there was 10 people in line ahead of us. Not 10 people waiting to pay, 10 people who already paid and were waiting to be seated. And, as I said earlier, there were several tables inside that were clearly empty. \\n\\nAt the end of the day, none of this would have really bothered me because I understand how things go: short staff, not everyone is at their table all the time, or they were more crowded than they appeared. I get it, things happen. \\n\\nThe thing that upset me the most is that larger parties will be seated first no matter when they show up. It didn't matter that there were, now 8, people in line for 45 minutes; they sat a group of 10 once their whole party showed up. And it's not like this was random or whatever there were two separate large parties that showed up after us and were seated before we even got close to the entrance. So they obviously had the staff.\\n\\nNow that I'm thinking about it I might not go back because I really don't want to have to experience that again.\\n\\nIn the end, we waited for an hour and a half when there were only 10 people in front of us when we got there, to having 6 people in front of us and the line behind us was way past the stanchions. \\n\\nI realized why the line was always so long whenever I passed by; it's because they just make you stand out front for no apparent reason.\\n\\nAfter an hour and thirty we asked for a refund because we were not going to have enough time to eat and make our show over at T-Mobile Arena.

The meats were all burnt and over cooked, there were no wagyu sliders as advertised,  I had to ask for then and a chef opened a drawer, pulled out a pan with a couple dozen of them,  took off the ceran wrap and placed one in a small plate and gave it to me. Clearly they aren't that fresh and ontop of all that,  it was severely undercooked and cold. Even our waiter told us we should not eat it. Dessert selection was subpar, Wynns buffet has more desserts. \\n\\nOverall it seems the buffet scene is dead in Vegas, quality is down everywhere,  your better off spending your money on one nice fancy dish!\",\n",
       " 'I was in Las Vegas for a convention and after reading so many rave reviews about the Bacchanal Buffet, decided to have lunch there. Expecting great food, I skipped breakfast.\\n\\nI was there for a late lunch at around 2:00pm and there was no line.  I paid and got seated in about 5 minutes.  I was excited and looked forward for a culinary delight but instead got a nightmare.\\n\\nAfter the first hour of the Buffet, I started to feel unwell and thought maybe I ate too much.  At the end of the Buffet, about two hours after being seated,  I felt really bad and I knew something was not right.  I asked for a cup of tea, hoping the warm tea would soothe away the discomfort.\\n\\nHowever, the tea did not help and I started to throw up.  Since I was seated at the back of the restaurant, I knew I would not make it in time to the bathroom, and I did not want to throw up in the middle of the dining room and inconvenience other diners.  I stayed at my table and threw up into the bowl and all over my jeans, TWICE.  I called a waitress who was passing by, told her what happened and asked her for some napkins.  She went and found some cloth napkins, handed them to me but offered no other help. \\n\\nWhen I was able to gather my strength, I started to walk to the bathroom.  I must have looked sick since the hostess in front asked me if I was okay.\\nI threw up again in the bathroom and felt really miserable.\\n\\nWhen I came out from the bathroom, I told the hostesses I wanted a refund.  I did not want to pay for the food that made me sick.  Since the hostesses could not make the decision, they had to go and get the Manager.\\n\\nThe Manager, Mr. Robert Quintero came. The first thing Mr. Quintero told me was Bacchanal does not have a refund policy, he then proceeded to conclude that I could not possibly have food poisoning.  He announced that he is a restaurant manager for many years and he knew that food poisoning took much longer than the 2+ hours I was there to show symptoms.\\n  \\nWith all due respect, Mr. Quintero is a restaurant manager, not a medical professional.  Puzzled about his reply, I later checked the website of the Mayo Clinic.  According to Mayoclinic.org, it is possible for food poisoning symptoms to show up 1 to 6 hours after consuming contaminated food. \\nThe site says that bacteria can be present in meats, prepared salads, cream sauces and cream-filled pastries, the symptoms of such poisoning could show up in 1 to 6 hours. The above mentioned food choices are plentiful at the Buffet.  \\n\\nThe point is not to imply that a particular contaminant was present in the food, or that the restaurant is not properly caring for its product (contamination happens, and no system is 100% safe), but rather that Mr Quintero is simply incorrect in his statement. Given his years in the food industry, I am surprised he said that, and it made me feel more that it was said mostly to dismiss my reasoning rather than acknowledge a problem. \\n\\nHe further suggested that maybe I ate some contaminated food in the morning.  I told him that was impossible since I was so looking forward to the \"one epic feast\" at the Bacchanal that I only had a cup of tea the whole day before the Buffet and I felt perfectly fine when I walked into his restaurant. He then implied maybe I was already sick without knowing it before I ate at his restaurant.  Again, all this made me feel like I was a problem that they just wanted to go away and that somehow I was trying to game the system. \\n\\nHe said he can talk to his Manager but he believed his Manager would have the same answers.  I asked him to try and he came back and told me his Manager said the exact same thing that he told me.  The only thing he could do is get my name and phone number and the kind of food I ate at the Buffet.  He would relate the incident to the appropriate department and some one would get back to me.\\n\\nTwo days have passed since the incident, and no one has called. At this stage, I would be surprised if I heard from any department.   \\n\\nThe bottom line is, beyond showing little empathy towards a customer who clearly was not well, the staff was not particularly helpful or friendly as I struggled to deal with this unpleasantness.  When I asked management to address the problem, I got the feeling that the blame was on me, and that I was not well from before.  All through the conversation, he did not inquire my well being nor offer a kind or comfort word.  The $43.29 refund I asked for weighed more to Bacchanal than good customer service. In the context of the reputation of the buffet (\"the best in Las Vegas,\" \"superb food choices,\" \"ridiculous amount of variety\", and so on), this is doubly disappointing.',\n",

       " \"Went here when it first opened and completely hated it other than the decor so years later when it's being touted as the best buffet in town I had to give it another try. I happy to say they are doing better but not by much. The food selection seemed like it went on forever and there was no way I was gonna be able to try everything. So I had to strategically go through the buffet.\\n\\nFirst stop the Asian station...I had the lumpia which didn't have a single piece of meat inside, the sesame balls which were reminiscent of Sunday dim sum with family, exactly 1 bite of the hot and sour soup because it tasted nothing like its name sake, and some roasted duck which Sam woo definitely does better. Oh and the pork stuffed chicken wing which didn't have much flavor\\n\\nNext was the American/carving station. The roast beef was cooked well but didn't have a lot of flavor. The everything corn was the highlight of this section...reminded me of elotes. The Mac n cheese has no flavor and the baked beans where no better than out of the can. The mashed potatoes at least look homemade cause the skin where mashed in but tasteless again.\\n\\nOn to the seafood bar...first had to try the hot crab and sadly too salty again. So I tried the cold crab to see it it had the same problem which it did. The oysters though were exactly what an oyster should be...fresh and tastes of the sea! The garlic soup in the escargot was delicious but the shrimp cocktail were small smooshy and water soaked...almost as if they had been thawed after being frozen for too long.\\n\\nLast of the savory was the Mexican section...the redeeming quality of this buffett was the man making the special order tacos...he was cheery, did a little chit chatting while cooking gave me my al pastor taco and informed me that all the condiments where at the end of the bar...he genuinely seemed like he enjoyed his job. The taco was pretty good too!\\n\\nLastly was the dessert bar...while the last time I visited the gelato bar was the only section in the buffet that held up to its reputation of offering new and innovative flavors, it just wasn't the case anymore...all the flavors had been replaced with classics...strawberry, chocolate, vanilla...the most complex flavor I could find was ginger green tea and this bar must have been the yin to the Mexican bar yang cause the man serving the ice cream could have not been in a pissyer mood...he hated his job! The buffet no longer makes the fresh soufflé thank god cause they were awful but they do offer freshly baked lava cake which were equally as bad...barely warm chocolate cake with no lava in the middle. \\n\\nAll in all I don't I will coming back to this buffet which is too highly priced, serves dreaded Pepsi products, and just doesn't match my taste buds when there are much better options in town.\",\n",
       " 'Not impressed with the food. We went there on a Saturday night and the place was so busy. We paid $54 per person. We thought there will king crab legs but guess what?  No king crab legs, only snow crab. It seems like the quality of the food has gone down compared to other Yelpers who posted pictures and reviews.  The lamb chops and the prime rib were tough and the sushi quality was the same as the supermarket. The oysters smelled fishy and the stone crab legs were hard to eat.  Some of the Asian hot dishes were good (roasted duck). Where were the individual fried chicken baskets? And the Mexican corn on the cob? This place was just like any other buffet now but more expensive. Yes, there were plenty of food but will not recommend anyone to go there unless you like spending money for lots of bad food.',\n",

While the food presentation was good, the food quality itself was extremely substandard, and most of the items were not hot, and were either overseasoned and salty, or rather tasteless.  The meat station items looked good, but the meat quality was poor, and the meat was so tough and salty that it was unedible.  All of the items with very few exceptions reminded me of an expensive version of Hometown Buffet.  The best station was the Italian items, and that isn't saying much.  If you know the difference between good food and mediocre food, do not waste your time here.  If you do not have developed tastes, then you will likely enjoy yourself.  I rate this as one of the great culinary disappointments in my dining experiences in Las Vegas.\",\n",

It\\'s cheese cake, even store bought cheese cake is delicious. I cut a piece with my fork and taste... Wth?! It\\'s straight cream cheese. Like Philadelphia cream cheese! I\\'m done.

We waited nearly an hour to be seated, and then every line for main courses were at least 20 people deep.

Stephanie, one of the managers, contacted me and asked if I would like to further discuss what happened. So we did through several emails and Stephanie, very apologetic offered me what appeared to be comped passes back to the buffet, (that appeared to seem fair to say the least, since my experience was cut short the first time due to food poisoning).  I was hesitant at first but figured if I was in town, why not give it another try since she seemed genuine about making things right and fair and perhaps it could have been an isolated circumstance the first time.  It is a buffet after all, with thousands of people passing through on a daily basis, not everything can be right all the time at any given moment, can it?  So we arrange a reservation and I get there.  To my utter shock and surprise, Stephanie said my comped passes were for a line jumping pass and a round of free cocktails--NOT FOR THE BUFFET. So she wanted me to pay for the buffet--something she could have easily straightforwardly told me through her several emails, but did not until I arrived in line at the cashier. Classic bait and switch? I believe so.  But wow...I thought customer service was an important thing to a place that claims to give its customer\\'s \"AN EPIC EXPERIENCE\" but this was quite far from it. Not only did they not care to make things right and FAIR to their customers, they tried to be sneaky using the good old baiting and switching/playing games to appear like they wanted to make things right.  Shame on you Bacchannal Buffet and your management for doing this and not caring to make things right or at least fair to your customers.

I would have done better to go to Little Caesar's.\\n\\nI have to that, in a lifetime of eating in buffet restaurants, from cruise ship buffets to hometown smorgasbords, this is the single worst experience I've ever had.\\n\\nWe pulled into Vegas exhausted and hungry after an 8-hour drive, and decided to just do the buffet at Caesar's Palace, where we were staying. We'd heard it was good, and, as we both have dietary restrictions, we thought it would be a pretty good bet. Usually we have no trouble finding enough that we can eat on a good buffet, and we were too tired to plow through restaurant listings to try to find something better that could accommodate us.\\n\\nBefore I go on to the food, I do have to mention the price. Yes, I get that everything in Vegas is expensive, but $116 for a buffet meal for two people that doesn't even include a beer is pretty OTT. I don't like most soft drinks, so that meant water for me (or pay more on top of the already outrageous price for something drinkable). We probably should have backed out at that point, but we were starving and we were on vacation, so...\\n\\nStill, it would have been OK if the food had been decent, but it was just horrible. In fact, It's difficult to describe just how terrible the food was. The salad greens were dried out and wilted. The salad dressings were completely mixed up, and dressings from one container dribbled into others. This was a serious problem, as my husband has a dangerous seafood allergy and one of the dressings was Caesar. None of the employees seemed to know which dressing was which, or what was in anything. We finally had to ask for  a separate bowl of ranch dressing to make sure he didn't get something that had been contaminated with seafood.\\n\\nOn the pizza bar, the only vegetarian choice was plain cheese, and it was bland and tasteless. I've had better pizza from the freezer compartment at Safeway. The rice and beans on the Mexican bar were also dried out and next to tasteless. Even the pita in the Mediterranean section was dry.

I tried calling to let them know cause it was the only thing we had eaten since breakfast, but no one answered. \\n\\nMy husband did say the street tacos were good, and I did like some of the \"Asian\" style food they had.  The ribs were ok, dessert was ok, but a lot of the cheese cake items and flan tasted over cooked or like they had been sitting out too long.

You \"register\" by putting a name and number in and it gives you a ticket saying come back (in 3 hours) at a certain time and check in. When you come back and check in you are simply put into yet another line and made to wait another 1.5 hours. What is the point of registering and giving your number? Would it be so difficult to send a text saying your table will be ready in 30 minutes(approx) please arrive no more than 15 minutes before said time. I didn\\'t come to Vegas to wait in lines all day. The food was good, but king crab was on the menu, and I saw some \"platinum and 7 stars\" eating it, but we were relegated to the less expensive snow crab.

We had high hopes for this considering all the buzz- But they need a traffic cop on this buffet line.  Food quality is good (shrimp, crab legs) -- But the logistics are a mess!  Tables are too close - and the overall layout makes folks step on top of each other to get to the food offerings.  We gave up trying!   The carving section (meats/etc.) - is directly in line with folks entering and exiting. The carving station line is also in front of other selections which we couldn't get to either - Frustrating! (this was during the week approx 5 pm) - It wasn't even that crowded.  The Asian fare was tasty, Italian needed more varied pasta - the desserts were good. But all in all - the selections are weaker than other top properties here in LV.   Some  selections were just dumped in pots and not labeled.   In fact, some of the off strip buffets have more and varied side dishes, veggies and desserts.  Additionally, the service is not nearly as attentive as in other properties both on strip and the local casinos.  At this price point - they need to step it up and fine tune it; better service, better variety and better access to the food itself.  Too much of an obstacle course and hassle.

I imagined a luxurious dining experience with the most amazing food choices and quality. What I found was a fairly standard buffet with some very questionable food items. The oysters tasted like they were from the muddiest bay and I was concerned for a bit they might have been bad. The sushi was far worse than I had had from local super markets. The sea bass had a rubbery texture and the sole barely tasted like fish. That all being said, offering stone crabs should have made up for the questionable quality but a handful of them tasted of ammonia. The balance of the food items (shrimp, calamari and sausages) were good but for $50+ per person, I expected more. I'm glad I went but I'm certain I would not choose another visit given the many other choices in town.\",\n",

Couple that with the extra 18% charge for parties over 8 people and you're looking at close to $77 per person. For that price one would expect something pretty decent at the very least. I have to say that I was extremely disappointed at the quality of the food, the layout of the buffet, and the overall experience. There was an extremely long line to get to the semi-decent stuff (like the meats). The meats were not that great either; the steak and beef were extremely tough and hard to chew. The steamed king crabs were way too salty to enjoy. The selection of cold seafood looked very unappetizing. The italian section had some slices of pizza that didn't look that good. The asian sushi section had food that looked on par with the stuff you get at $20 asian buffets. The dessert section was something you can get at a $30 buffet. To top that off the biffet was extremely crowded and they ran out of plates. Overall I personally think that this one is a huge rip and not worth the wait and the money. Skip\",\n",

       " \"Maybe that is the problem with high expectations...\\n\\nI've heard for a few months now how I had to try the Bacchanal Buffet and how it was the best in Vegas.  I understand the days fo the $9.99 buffet are over and I have no issue shelling out $40-$50 for a premium buffet...but when I do so, I expect premium food and service.\\n\\nHonestly, I didn't find the food to be spectacular, or at least enough so to make me forget about the horrible service.  There were many items I enjoyed throughout my many samplings.  Overall, I was just perplexed at time by the set up and extremely frustrated by the service.  Maybe someone can help me with this one.  You have a long line building for crab legs (rightfully so) but why put the drawn butter at the beginning of the line...with no cups or other dishes to hold said butter.  Should i just lather it on an empty plate?  Upon further review, perhaps the crab legs should have been the START of the line and the butter the end...this would also explain why lemons, tartar sauce, horseradish and cocktail sauce were AFTER the chilled shrimp.  If this is the case, then why isn't there someone directing traffic?  I mean it wouldn't hurt to have people using the buffet the way it was designed instead of lining up the wrong way and getting in the way of the staff trying to go in and out of the kitchen and dodging swinging doors and carts.  The lines were going completely backwards.  You'd expect a place dubbed as the best to operate like a well oiled machine.\\n\\nAnother perplexing thing is how the line to get in is so incredibly long to get in but then inside the place is half empty and seemingly understaffed.  I'm looking around at waiters standing around, managers setting tables, dirty tables, and I can't get a drink order filled.  Our original waitress disappeared for awhile after serving us initially before I spotted her standing around doing nothing in another section.  I asked two different people and waited roughly 20 minutes for a drink towards the tail end of the meal before we decided to get up and leave.  This was all after we sat around for 10 minutes before a waitress even came by to take the first drink order.  Two beverages in 60+ minutes and nobody walking around filling up waters seems a bit unacceptable.  In addition, nobody came by to clear used dishes and glasses until we were almost forced to turn around and put them on an empty table just to make room.  I mean this seems like Buffet 101 type stuff to me...when people get up to get another plate, you clear the previous plate and/or bring a drink.  I don't know if we caught them at a bad day/time but $52 and a 30 minute wait is a bit too steep for me to run back and find out, especially with other good options down the street.  When comparing to Wicked Spoon in terms of price, food, and service, I would choose Wicked Spoon every time.\",\n",
       " 'We stopped in during our vacation in Las Vegas, on the recommendation of several friends who had been there in the last 2 to 3 years. It was a disaster, being too expensive and the food was terrible. Plus, it seemed that there was some ingredient in the food that made us feel full. We usually eat 3 times what we did at this \"international\" buffet.\\n\\nFirst, we had to get instructions, from a woman, who told us that we had to go to a kiosk and get a ticket. The ticket told us, that we had to wait 61 minutes, before we could get in the line to buy into the international buffet.. We were in that line for 30 minutes, before we got to the teller that wanted $58.00 per person to eat at the \"international\" buffet. Took us at least 20 minutes to pay her. So after 2 hours we finally got to our seats and started to get some food. I waited at the table while the other 2 went and got food, no one approached me during that 15 minute wait. They looked happy about their selection, so off I went to find something to eat. So 2 hours and 15 minutes later, I\\'m searching for food.\\n\\nSecond, walking down the food line, I searched through the crowd for items I might be interested in, not much caught my eye. After walking almost a block and half, I got to the beginning of the food line. Picked out some beef pepper steak, scalloped potatoes, some green beans, crab rangoons, fried asparagus and waffle wrapped chicken. Got back to my seat after 20 minutes of walking the food line. Now, 2 hours and 35 minutes have passed. The beef pepper steak, green beans and fried asparagus were all cold. Scalloped potatoes were tasty and hot. The crab rangoons had no crab in them, just cream cheese. The waffle wrapped chicken was hot, but the waffle part tasted awful,l so I peeled it off the partial chicken breast piece and ate the hot tasteless chicken. My friends had each gotten some sliders, which weren\\'t there when I walked through, they said that the sliders were good. They also got some prime rib, of which, one got some almost raw meat and the other had to have it cooked a lot more. I couldn\\'t get any prime rib on the first time through, as too many people were crowding the station. They each also got some cheese/sauce covered chicken breast filets, they said they were good. There weren\\'t any either time I walked the food line. A waitress had brought drinks to the table while I was away. As I was eating my friends went back through the food line and came back to the table with some other food. Then I went a second time to get some food. There were some sliders, this time, and I was able to get some prime rib, which was now cooked a lot more. As I was leaving the \"meat window\", they brought out some HOT sweet potato tots which were great hot. Got some watermelon too. My friends didn\\'t eat much of what they got the second time, complaining of being full. I ate my prime rib, which was tender, but tasteless, after salt and peppering it,  I managed to get it down before it went cold. By this time my sliders were cold and the meat was raw, so I didn\\'t eat them. I was starting to feel full too. I ate my watermelon and my friends went and tried some desserts, which there were unable to finish because of being too full. While I was getting my second plate, a waitress came by and left some receipts for the sodas at $6.00 each. On the receipt was a note that we were requited to limit our \"dining experience\" to 2 hours. Each time they refilled our glasses we got more and more ice and less and less soda.\\n\\nThere were mashed potatoes and gravy, 4 kinds of pizza, crab legs, muscles and shrimp on ice and all sorts of breads. I think that there were baked potatoes, but not sure. They had oyster shooters and some salad makings. I could not find any hot shrimp dishes, either breaded fried or stir-fried with or without veggies. Maybe hot/warm shrimp is a supper item.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we got charged $192.00 (3 of us) for waiting in line for 2 hours and 35 minutes to eat terrible cold food and raw meat and be filled up on eating so much less food than either of us was used to eating. I would recommend that you skip this \"international\" buffet and go anywhere else. If you like cold crab legs and cold muscles, I recommend getting a \"Caesar\\'s player\\'s card\" or a \"buffet of buffets pass\". At least your culinary disaster will be cheaper than ours.',\n",

Unfortunately, none of the bites I sampled were actually fresh. They seemed like they had been plated and left uncovered hours previously. What a let down. This joint has tons of potential!  I  was expecting stellar customer service and attention to detail. Our server only managed to visit twice during our visit.

The best seating with space are the booths against the wall. Walking through this is a challenge because you have to change directions every few steps to avoid hitting a chair. You practically zigzag your way to the food. Upon being seated  (8pm) our server wasn\\'t around to take our drink order after 3min we decided it\\'s time to eat! \\n\\nAs we work our way though the maze if seats and tables it became very obvious to me this place is probably the smallest buffet compared to all the other top hotels which lead to why it was so congested inside the food area. Most if not all of the food is against one wall. There is no clear place where the start of the line begins because all the different types of food is on one counter. Picture it like the longest cafeteria line. Was this how the designer drew this place up? Horrible! \\n\\nThe beginning of this line starts in china. It looked ok and smelled pretty good but I wasnt going to fill my belly with Panda Express. Btw...I did notice they had chicken feet! Cool! The line was moving slowly but I passed by Ramen bar, Salad bar, Italian Bar, Pizza bar, nacho/taco bar, appetizer bar then that was it! Huh? No way! But wait, there\\'s another line to goto! \"Calgon take me away! Beetle juice beetle juice beetle juice!\" FML! \\n\\nSo this line is a bit slower than the 1st but from this point I\\'m expecting the goodies! In this part small treys are displayed like pork belly, Chilean sea bass, salmon, sautéed  vegetables. Then next up is the carving station which had flank steak,  Pork ribs, beef ribs, lamb chops, brisket, sausage and chicken. Finally reached the pot of gold; seafood! Here you\\'ll find the usual but why there\\'s only 1 spot for each I dunno. I think the line would go faster if there was at least two areas for each. Anyways there was crawfish, king crab, stone crab, oysters and shrimp. People flocking incl myself to get a taste of something that is the same in all the other buffets. \\n\\nI finally get to sit down with my 2 plates of food and luckily my girl beat be back and ordered my drank. Like I said in the last paragraph, food didint taste any different than your typical buffet. So I was pretty disappointed because I was expecting greatness from all the positive reviews from yelp. \\n\\nFor my 3rd and 4th plate I filled it up with all different types of desserts. I guess when your full of food, dessert isn\\'t so yummy. Once again nothing stood out. Pineapple pena cotta was very sweet, mango pounding was still liquidy, sangria bread pudding tasted like Xmas bread food blah blah blah. \\n\\nThe time now was 9:50pm. My server hadn\\'t offer to refill my iced tea and my stomach was full from navel to esophagus however my taste buds were left with a unsatisfaction of flavors not received. For the price I paid, ordering mcdonalds would have done same thing but much cheaper of course. \\n\\nBtw...there wasn\\'t lobster, ribeye or tarot tots like yelp pics. \\n\\nTo read the beginning of my review check out Caesars place review. \\n\\nIf not there were yellow flags about entering this place as well as the hassle to get here lol! \\n\\nThanks!',\n",
       " 'Sure the experience was cool, but the food was a disappointment,service was terrible not worth it for the price. The only things good were prime rib, crab,tacos and the dessert bar.  The bus staff was very slow to clean our tables and others. The soups were good but not hot enough, barely warm soup. We were at the brunch buffet and the sushi selection was very minimal. There were NO SIGNATURE dish that make this place stand out versus other buffet.',\n",
       " \"Ate there last night and was very disappointed and left sick. The service is terrible! Don't order the bottomless drinks because the server never comes back to get you another drink I paid $15 for one small glass of wine. The cold food was warm and the hot food was just luke warm. The food isn't very good quality. Then to top it off my boyfriend and I both got sick and threw up all $135 of what we ate. NEVER GOING BACK!\",\n",
       " 'For lunch: Wicked Spoon is better Bacchanal. \\n\\nMy gf and I came here for lunch. $33/person, about 1.5 hour wait and we got there at 11:30am. There is a line to get a ticket, which tells you when to come back to pay and get a seat. There was an option to enter if it was a special occasion. It was my gf\\'s birthday, so I checked the box marked \"birthday\" and wondered what special thing would happen. Spoiler: nothing happened throughout our time there, and no one acknowledged it. Why put an option to mark if it\\'s someone\\'s birthday if absolutely nothing will happen when you check it? Anyway, when we got back at our designated time, we had to wait about 20 minutes in a line to pay. The group in front of us was supposed to come back 2 hours later (they had just gotten their ticket), but the hostess and cashier didn\\'t care and let them pay and enter anyway, while the rest of us honest folk waited to return at our designated time. At the time of payment, I had to put a tip. This is weird to me, because I like to adjust my tip based on the service provided by the server. The cashier then pointed out to me that this tip would go to my server. Okay, how do they know who my server is when we don\\'t even have our seat yet? \\n\\nIt was then another 10 minutes after we paid before we were taken to our seat. I put the receipt - with the tip labeled on it - down on the table and after our server asks for what drinks we want she picks up the receipt and looks at it in detail. I don\\'t know why she did this. Like any person would, I am sure she saw the tip I had left. And like any person would do, she probably decided in her mind to give us a certain level of service based on the tip that was preemptively given. Overall, the service by her, the cashier, and the host were poor, but the man bussing our table was significantly more friendly, and brought us ketchup and refilled our drinks for us, and we saw him more than we saw our server.  \\n\\nHighlights and lowlights of some of the food:\\nMaple-syrup tater tots - very good!\\nFilet mignon - delicious, made me eat all of it even though I was stuffed\\nFried chicken - it was very dry. KFC has better fried chicken\\nMade-on-the-spot carnitas tacos - bland, not exciting\\nLabels were inconsistent. Some foods had labels, others did not. The salsa bar had no labels.\\nSausages - average\\nThe Chinese food - my gf said they did this section well\\nDesserts - underwhelming. The best I had was the flan. The \"thai\" gelato tasted like vanilla. There was no honey display.\\nOverall the presentation of the food was sub-par. If you have been to Wicked Spoon, you will understand the difference in the food presentation.\\n\\nI think this place is overrated. Wicked Spoon has a much better lunch buffet, better service, is cheaper, and has a similar ambiance. I would recommend you go to Wicked Spoon than Bacchanal.',\n",
       " 'So, I was excited to go to the Bacchanal Buffet, considering it is relatively new and Caesars had spent millions ($17 million quoted on USA Today\\'s review) in creating it.   Many recent ratings and reviews of Las Vegas buffets calling it \"the best\" or \"one of the best\" buffets in Las Vegas.  The buzz for this Las Vegas buffet has been great.  \\n\\nI cannot truthfully agree whatsoever.  \\n\\nTwo dined at lunch on a Monday.  Food was fair at best.  Not very flavorful across the board.  Too salty at times.  The seafood putanesca was overly salty and the small octopus/calamari was raw (had to spit out the slimy glob onto the plate).  The carnitas meat was bland, no flavor there.  The pizza crust was acceptable but the cheese and sauce was lousy.   The Asian station had OK sushi.  The warm Asian food station was not marked and was fair also.  Desserts were hit or miss.  The creme brulee was gummy and eggy (which I absolutely hate).  The Oreo mousse dessert was good.\\n\\nI somewhat liked the seafood station, and oysters and shrimp were good.  Of course they did not keep the oyster area stocked as oysters can be expensive and labor intensive.  I walked by it multiple times to check it out and every time it revealed a scene of a couple weak looking ones left behind, half out of their shelly-lair freezing on the ice.  The shrimp was decently stocked but some were mushy, but one could find healthy-firm shrimp if dug though the pile.  The salami and cheese in the Italian station was decent. The gelato bar was exciting with many flavors but the scoops were very tiny, about the size of quarter. \\n\\nThe waiter brought a wine that was not the one ordered, or listed on the menu.  It was about $10 more for the bottle and a much lesser quality than the one that was ordered.   It was noted that a couple next to us asked for napkins 3 times before they received them.  \\n\\nSpending $130 (for two) for this experience at lunch was unfortunate and a crime considering all of the positive press. There are numerous restaurants on the strip that far exceed the Bacchanal Buffet in both quality and value.   \\n\\nIt is quite obvious Caesars is cutting corners and charge higher prices than other buffets due to their investment in this buffet.',\n",
       " 'A total disappointment!  Literally ate one bite of each dish hoping it wouldn\\'t be a fail...but it was.\\n\\nThe food is DEFINITELY not worth the price that was paid.  Seafood was lackluster and had few options.  Crab was waterlogged (even the \"hot\" version was waterlogged).  \\n\\nThe meat carving section was not good.  BBQ ribs and brisket were waaaay too smokey.  The prime rib seemed like it was rushed through cooking and the person at that station did not know how to cut the meat properly (cutting it into weird chunks, instead of the typical slices).  \\n\\nThe rest of the hot foods were forgettable.  As mentioned earlier, you\\'ll only have one bite of each dish and be disappointed. \\n\\nThe desserts were meh as well.  The only thing that WASN\\'T a total fail was the creme brulee.  Although if the only thing that was worth getting a second time (or taking a second bite of) was a small aluminum foil dish of creme brulee, that in itself is a fail.\\n\\nServers were nice, but inattentive.  Water glasses were empty for the majority of the meal and it took a long time to get ahold of anyone.\\n\\n\\n\\nWound up going to Wicked Spoon two nights later and was totally satisfied there.',\n",
       " 'Wow! What has happened to this place???? I mean it is a monday for god sakes! Service was horrible, table on both sides of us were nasty eith filthy plates and no one there we finished earinf and left and still no one cleaned them up!  Food type has changed, no full salad bar, deserts have changed as well! I was very disappointed!!!! Will never come back again! Honestly I felt like I was at a mediocre buffett. Guess we have yo go back yo Bellagio buffet from now on!',\n",
       " \"Love the food at this buffet! Very large selection and my companion and I are smart so we usually try to go around 10:30-11:30AM to avoid long wait times. Hosts are friendly. Food is 5/5. Want to know why I gave it two stars? Guess what time we got asked what we wanted to drink? We were asked 45 minutes after devouring two plates! We tried to flag numerous servers down but of course they were too busy running like chickens. Not going to lie, I'd come again though!\",\n",
       " 'First Thoughts: \"Voted Number 1 Buffet by USA Today.\" Let\\'s see about that. \\n\\nWhen we arrived at Bacchanal at 11:30 am, we had to wait in a short line for about 10 minutes to get our print-out slip from the automated kiosk. We had to punch in our party size and we were told to come back at our designated time. We were told for our party of 2, the total wait was about 47-58 minutes and we were told to come back to pay at around 12:25 pm. We came back at our designated time and waited to pay--in yet another line. This line took about 20-25 minutes. We noticed the party of 3 ahead of us had a print-out slip that told them to come back to pay at 2:10 pm. It was obvious they had cut the line and judging from their dodgy behavior--they knew it too. My bf scoffed and said they would probably be turned away at the cashier; they weren\\'t. It was utter bullshit that while honest people, like ourselves, were waiting our turns, others could just cut in line and Bacchanal would turn a blind eye. The cashier did nothing and the kicker: they were seated before us.\\n\\nWhen it was finally our turn to pay, the cashier pointed out the tip section of the receipt and so my bf had to write down his tip amount--BEFORE we had been served. This seems entirely backwards to me. Why have your patrons pay for a service they have not received yet? You leave tips based on the kind of service received during the meal--not before. Nonetheless, this left an even more sour taste in our mouths and did nothing to mollify the frustrations of waiting in 2 separate lines to pay. Once the monetary transaction was completed, we found ourselves waiting in, you guessed it, another line--this time to be seated. This line was significantly shorter but it is deceiving since I had assumed I\\'d be seated after we paid. The hostess took us to our seats and we were greeted by our sever who looked at the receipt. She asked us for our respective drinks and I think we saw her another 2x during our 2 and a half hour meal. Ridiculous. \\n\\nAs for the food, itself, the quantity and diverse variety is really impressive. I really enjoyed the Chinese section and was pleased that the chefs knew how to speak Cantonese. That\\'s always a good sign! The XO green beans and stir-fry fish were stand-out dishes for me. The \"wok hei\" was great in both dishes and I went back for seconds. The shrimp har gow had a thick translucent skin reminiscent of some of the best har gow I\\'ve had in the 626. The char siu was also very tender and not overly salty and sweet. I went back for seconds (and thirds)! The sweet custard bao was good but my one gripe about the baos would be that they are left far too long in their steamer containers. When they are first placed in the baskets, they are good but 15 minutes later, the soft bao skin gets hard and crusty. Nevertheless, Bachannal has one of the best Asian sections in all the Vegas buffets I\\'ve been to. \\n\\nOther than the good Asian section, none of the other food sections stood out to me. Most of the foods were unlabeled so even if I did enjoy something, I didn\\'t know what I was eating half the time. We were eating at 1 pm so Bacchanal really has no excuse to not put up adequate signage on their dishes. The Mexican and seafood section seemed to be pretty popular. I thought the carnitas were too salty and I liked the creamy rice dishes from the seafood section. Wish I could tell you what they were but you know, it\\'s kind of hard to do that when the signs were not put up! \\n\\nThe dessert section was entirely underwhelming. I thought the crepe station looked neat but I was too stuffed to try it. Presentation was not nearly as nice as Wicked Spoon\\'s and I thought the containers full of candy (jelly beans, gummy candies and Hershey\\'s kisses) was a cop-out. I want less candy I can buy from CVS and more gourmet desserts. The gelato was awful. I got a scoop of Thai tea gelato and it tasted like vanilla. When I had ordered the same gelato at Wicked Spoon, the gelato tasted authentic!  \\n\\nAlso, my bf had taken me to Bacchanal as part of my birthday lunch. When we were checking into the kiosk, they asked us if were were celebrating a special occasion like a birthday or an anniversary. My bf checked \"birthday\". Nothing happened. No one acknowledged it on Bacchanal\\'s end so why bother asking? If anything, asking the question made us anticipate something happening. We were not pleased. \\n\\nBottom line: Go to Wicked Spoon. For the price of $32/ person for a weekday lunch, the overall food, service and experience did not justify the price or its USA today accolades, for that matter. \\n\\nBacchus would not be pleased and neither was I.',\n",
       " 'This review is more for the staff than the food. The food was fine, but I think Wicked Spoon is a much nicer place to eat, this place felt a little worn out and the service was lack luster. \\n\\nMy main issue is that halfway through our meal, an elderly waitress came up to me (and a woman a few tables away from me) and told us individually that we weren\\'t welcome to breastfeed our babies there. Neither her nor I were showing as much as an inch of skin and in fact I\\'m surprised she could even tell I was feeding my child as I was wearing an oversized black sweater.\\n\\nBoth the other woman and myself were so taken aback by it, it\\'s never been an issue for either of us, myself in LA and her in Vancouver- neither of us had ever been reprimanded. We were just discreetly feeding our 8 month olds as mothers everywhere do.\\n\\nI felt so unwelcomed and when the manager, whom I asked to see, came over she didn\\'t really have much to say aside from \"um, sorry?\". Barely an apology for making me so uncomfortable after spending a ton of money at their restaurant. \\n\\nSuper tacky and totally behind the times. And especially ironic in LAS VEGAS where there were scantily clad women all around us. \\n\\nBreastfeeding mothers are not welcome here and that\\'s not a place I choose to support.',\n",
       " 'I am livid about our experience here tonight. It was the ONE place my son wanted to go in Las Vegas. We called before getting an Uber and the operator told us it was currently a 30 min wait. We hopped in an Uber and $20 later we were at Caesars. There is a very meek woman at the entrance to the line. I asked how long the wait was and she said 45 minutes but you have to check in here first - pointing to a digital kiosk. I entered my info in the kiosk and the stated wait time was 37 minutes. Great. We killed time walking around and came back at the specified time. The last opens the rope to the line. We were alarmed at how many people were there and asked how much longer the wait would be. Another 45-60 minutes. We have show tickets so we had to leave. And now another $20 Uber ride to get back where we need to be. Without dinner. \\nI get that the place is popular and there is a line. Which is why I called ahead. HORRIBLE service and crowd management.',\n",

I wasn't impressed with the quality of the food here. If I'm paying $53 I better get some damn good seafood. No lobster? Cold and nasty tasting crab legs?

Lamb chops were very good though.\\n\\nAsian section had an ok variety of things. Tried the bbq duck and it was completely overcooked. Sushi section could've been better. Serve some yellowtail nigiri and I'll love this place more.\\n\\nI like the concept of mini sized plates with something small to sample it. I tried the beef slider, pork belly with carrot puree and grits with spicy sausage. Only one I enjoyed was the pork belly.\\n\\nI like the Mexican station with their street tacos. Got to try the steak and al pastor and loaded it up after the lady finished making my tacos.\\n\\nBy the time I got to desserts I was too damn full to stock up on sweets so I only got to try 2 flavors of their gelato and a chocolate cake on a stick. Banana cream and Italian cookies and cream were the ones I sampled. Banana cream was good but the Italian cookies and cream was not good. The chocolate  cheesecake on a stick was ok.\\n\\nBut let's be real. I didn't pay $53 to fill up on tacos. I wanted some damn good food and all I got out of it was average food I could've gotten elsewhere for a lot less money. I spent almost $200 for a mediocre experience and while I'm glad I finally got to try the most expensive buffet in Vegas, I wouldn't return unless I was comped. I'll settle for the other buffets on the strip.\\n\\nThe fruit juices they have in the little glass bottles were pretty good.\\n\\nOne last thing.

The mac and cheese was unexplainably gross! The dim sum, prime rib, Asian rices, and mimosas were are plain and bland. The sushi was mediocre. The lumpia was ok. The egg drop soup and hot and sour soup were disgusting, had a weird aftertaste. The Nutella crepes were good, but those are hard to mess up. Pass on the topping for the crepe it is overly sweet and runny. The chocolate mousse left a lot to be desired and definitely do not try the tapioca. The apricot topping and tapioca mix stirred a undesirable feeling in my stomach! The cheese cake was overpowered by cream cheese. Bright side, coffee was good!

       " 'AWFUL!  AVOID!  I\\'ve had it with the overpriced buffets in Vegas.  Saturday and Sunday brunch price is not advertised on the website and you can\\'t just buy breakfast on Saturday or Sunday.  So, my girlfriend and I decided to give it a try because of all the great review, but no brunch buffet is $41.99 per person.  I\\'m not opposed to paying up for good food, but seriously, all I wanted was eggs, bacon and some toast.  Don\\'t be a tourist.  \\n\\nThis place is designed by the same people who brought you the Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan as evidenced by the posts that hold the ropes for the line.  Unfortunately, they don\\'t have nearly the amount of space as the Wicked Spoon, so there\\'s a ton of seating, but the buffet is crowded by the tables and people coming in.  In essence, you\\'re cramped down to a single line along the buffet and with barely 25% of the seats in the place filled, there were long lines for the carved meat, seafood and omellete stations and there are only one of each.  \\n\\nMy girlfriend paid for brunch since I paid for dinner the night before, but from the moment my jaw dropped upon seeing the price - $90 and change for two people - things just kept getting worse.  We were first seated at a table which didn\\'t have enough room to get into the second seat because it was crowded by a floor lamp.  They did move us, but I was extremely frustrated by this point.\\n\\nMimosas are included with the exorbitant price, so I ordered two and my girlfriend went to get food.  She had barely sat down when a child, obviously neglected by his parents, lobbed this little rubber handle they give you to pick up the metal dishes at the buffet at her, hitting her in the hair and then bouncing off her and landing right in the middle of the plate.  It was covered in BBQ sauce, so now she\\'s go sauce in her hair and this thing right in the middle of the plate of food she\\'d just waited in three different lines to get.  Next, the \\'owner\\' of the kid (I say that because he obviously had no parenting skills) starts mouthing off to us and which point I just started motioning for the wait staff or anybody else who attention I could get.  As much as I wanted to rip him limb from limb (he did quiet down a bit when I stood up and he realized I was 6\\'5\"/300), it\\'s better to let the hotel handle it and I figured this way my chance to get out of this awful experience and get our money back.  As the manager approached, he started mouthing off again, swearing, etc. and I just told the manager I wanted this awful experience to end.  She took us to the front which calling security on the guy with the kid and refunded our money.\\n\\nOverall, and awful experience.  They did solve the problem and we did get our money back, but the bottom line is it\\'s just another buffet and at $41.99/person, you can go to a decent restaurant for breakfast twice, get better food and not have to deal with the idiot tourists.\\n\\nUpon leaving, we went to Crystal\\'s at City Center and ended up having lunch at Wolfgang Puck\\'s.  Yea, I know it\\'s a chain and I\\'ve eaten at the one at O\\'Hare too many times, but the service was fantastic, the food was good as usual and the atmosphere was soooooo much better.',\n",

       " \"If this had been the first buffet we had ever tried in Vegas I would've thought it was the best thing ever. However it was not the first buffet we had been to and compared to the others we had been to it was no different than them. Their was nothing on this buffet that was good enough for me to be able to justify spending 60 dollars/person. They have crab legs and so does every other buffet at dinner in Vegas. They make crepes for you at the desert station and so does the Paris buffet. They have sushi but other than the sashimi it was gross. Our waitress was not very attentive and while I don't expect much from them anyway at a buffet she was even less attentive than expected. The Mac and cheese tasted like it was from stoufers and not fresh. Compared to other buffets it IS good don't get me wrong, but it not what it's hyped up to be and not worth the price. I would've rather spent that money at a nicer restaurant.\",\n",
       " 'Not ok! This Buffet has a lot of hype around it, but let me tell you , skip the whole thing.  There are a ton of variety, but the quality is very much lacking.  For 70 a person after tax, I expect the food to be just as amazing as a 4 star restaurant, well it was not!\\n Seafood was flavorless and watery, oysters had tons of dirt and sediment. Asian food was oily and too sweet.  Waygu beef had no flavor.  The waiter came over once to give us drinks and that was it.\\n\\nDo your stomach a favor and skip the buffet for a nice sit down restaurant.  But if you would rather eat 6 plates of crap vs 1 plate of amazingness, then this is your place. \\n\\nI would NEVER go back and would NEVER recommend this place, in fact I would actively discourage people to go.',\n",
       " \"NOT WORTH YOUR TIME AND MONEY. \\nSure they have prime rib, crab legs and other meat and seafood BUT please save your time and money for something else. You are better off eating in a fancy restaurant and spending $30 per head than this. It is just a hype! \\n\\nFor $60/head, you would expect exceptional service and a complete array of food in the buffet. You won't get it at this joint. Bowls and plates weren't refilled and food at the buffet felt like leftovers. The taste was meh for some dishes too. Also, don't get me startedon the wait. It's a good 3 hours of your life you will never get back. \\n\\nIf you are looking for a buffet to eat at in vegas, you are better off going to the one at M.\",\n",

Waiting in the large group line currently and with still around 100 behind us. The small group lines have about 300 still in line. After numerous requests, no one is able to tell us when to stop waiting so people who cannot eat here before they close in 1.5 hours can still have a Christmas dinner. Extremely poor organization of lines and of the people waiting show that this place does not really about its customers and clearly lacks the people and skill to deal with the lines and fame that it somehow accrued over the years. No matter the quality of food, people should be in a position to enjoy it, no?\",\n",

I ate there the night before Thanksgiving. The food was either too salty or too sweet. Most of it, except for the salad veggies, was inedible. And the horrible duf duf music was too much. We asked the manager to please turn it down but he refused. He just simply didn't care.\\n\\nWhat was particularly shocking was the oversalted Asian food. Asian food does not need to be oversalted.

Dinner transition does not happen at 3. They were in the weeds and it was still mostly brunch food once we left. So you could end up paying the dinner price after 3 but be eating the brunch stuff.\\n\\nTon of soup stations. Taco area is pretty cool, but you cannot make your money back on carne asada. Sushi section sucks. They have cold crab legs for lunch, steamed for dinner. The meats are basically the same for lunch and dinner, but they add lamb and beef ribs. Beef Ribs were awesome. I loved those. Bone Marrow was really good also but it needed to come with some bread or cracker. The Wagyu Steak and Prime Rib were both flavorless and not tender.\\n\\nDessert bar looks fancy but its pretty mediocre.

       " \"My cousin and aunt came in from NYC last Saturday.  We had been planning the trip for six months and had prepaid for helicopter rides, show tickets, the whole nine yards.  I recommended Caesar's Buffet because I have heard so many good things about it.  It is been the worst experience of the week!  We were gravely disappointed!  I had been told there were lobster tails there, but upon arrival I saw a sign in the case that said $62 for a whole lobster - nothing about a lobster tail.  We had to wait AN HOUR AND A HALF for shrimp!!!!  We kept going up and the man said they were waiting for it to come from the warehouse!  Did they not know they were serving dinner that day????  Several of the dishes looked like they had been left over from lunch - and some were not very tasty.  There were a few items we liked, but were very dissatisfied over the lobster and shrimp.  By the time the shrimp arrived we were ready to leave.  That was ridiculous.  But what was even more ridiculous was the fact that we had such difficulty getting someone to give us a drink and refill ...that my cousin had to actually get up and get the pitcher to refill our own iced tea!!!!!!!  I have never been so embarrassed in my life to have recommended a pricey buffet and have all of this happen!\",\n",
       " \"Just no.\\n\\nYelp led me here with its great rating, especially for a buffet, but I will never go back nor will I recommend it to anyone. The ambiance and the service was nice, but be real- you go to a buffet for the food and with the exception of the taco station and the sweet potato tater tots, the food was not good.\\n\\nI've never paid so much for a buffet so I thought surely, this place must be legit. But no. My husband and I are the buffeters who do it right and go for the good stuff first then dink around with the filler foods. First of all, there was no Alaskan king crab legs, even at dinner. Just snow crab. We got a plate of steamed crab legs and they were tasteless! The cold legs were actually better, but those were bad too. Not a lot of meat and no flavor. We usually shamelessly go through at least two full plates of crab legs each, but we didn't even want to waste room on these. Fine, we'll go to the next best thing: prime rib. Their prime rib was the worst I've ever had in my life. They weren't even the slightest bit pink in the middle and I like mine rare, but not only was it over-cooked, it was tough and gritty and after I took a bite, my mood was ruined and I lost all hope. The two main things I go to a buffet for were crap! We spent the rest of our dinner picking at and pushing around filler foods on our plate and left unhappy and underwhelmed. Were they having an off-day? Perhaps, but at $118 for two people, I can't afford an off-day and neither can they. Shame.\",\n",

It is quite pricey (almost 140 dollars for 2 people including 15% tip).  There is a large selection, including a seafood section, western-style meats section, chinese food section, sushi section, and a taco station.  There is also a wide selection of desserts.  I ate quite a bit of seafood - crab legs, oysters, shrimp.  They were average and nothing to shout about - oysters were not very fresh.  I was impressed that they had a roasted suckling pig - however, it was a let down as the skin was soggy and not crispy at all.  The rest of the food was ok, but the worst was probably the sushi - rice was not cooked properly.  \\n\\nAll in all, a less than stellar experience with a large selection of food (though i've seen more selections in other buffets in other countries), with mediocre to average food quality.\",\n",

       " \"I have never written a Yelp review, but after last night's experience here, I feel if I can save just one person from wasting his or her money and time at this buffet, I will be doing my good deed of the day. I consider myself a major foodie, I have been in the food and restaurant business for 18 years, I own two very successful food trucks and I used to write restaurant reviews for our local paper. Let me put a disclaimer here, I do not eat red meat, so I came here to indulge in its seafood offerings. \\n   My boyfriend and I got to the buffet around 4:15 on Sunday afternoon and there was already a huge queued line. We we told to sign in at the kiosk and we would be given a time to come back. We had two hours to whet out appetite, so we walked around the Venetian. We returned as instructed at 6:21 and were escorted to the end of the huge line. We were told there was still ANOTHER 2-hour wait. My boyfriend wanted to leave and I urged him to wait it out. After 10 minutes in line, we were approached by 3 people who asked us if we wanted to join them to form a group of 6 because there is another line for large groups of 6 or more and the wait is just an hour. I went with them and boyfriend stayed in original line just in case his would be faster. My new family of 5 recruited 4 more people in the line and went to wait with another mass of people. After about an hour, my alliance was corralled to pay $68 a person, sales tax and a forced 18% gratuity for a group of 8 or more. \\n   I excitingly went up to the huge smorgasbord ready to indulge in the fruits of the sea. My first plate was stone crab claws, chilled snow crabs, raw oysters on the half shell, cold steamed shrimp and grilled prawns. The stone crab claws were over cooked and very hard to open, a nut cracker and small seafood fork was never offered, but this would not have helped with the sub par quality. The crab legs were very skimpy and split in half, but there was just not enough meat to make eating them satisfying. The posted menu stated snow crabs and King crabs were on the buffet, but there were no king legs to be found. I know the difference in the species and appearance of crabs. The raw oysters were flavorless, the muscle was not detached from the shell and were room temperature. The chilled shrimp were limp and because I am in the seafood business, I am 98% sure, they were shipped in frozen from Asia already peeled and deveined. They did not taste or have the consistency of a fresh shrimp. The only thing I thought was good on the whole buffet was the jumbo grilled prawns. These were split in half, flavored with butter, garlic and herbs and were almost as large as a small split lobster tail.\\n   I tried some other seafood dishes on my second trip. Cooked mussels with a coconut curry sauce, steamed clams with a beurre blanc some some sort of small salmon filet. The mussels were cold and over cooked. The small clams had the same temperature and cooking issues, but the butter sauce was tasty. The salmon filet was also room temperature and way over cooked. \\n   Next I went up for steamed crab legs. I waited in a 5-minute line and the cook started loading legs on my plate. I was hoping these would be served whole, but they were also split and way over cooked. I asked the attendant where the king crab legs were and he proceeded to pull one out of one of the three pots. My plate only had snow crabs. My guess is they pepper these more expensive crabs few and far between in the mix.\\n   I was so full of mediocre food, I had little room for dessert. I tried a Bananas Foster crepe. The cook made me a fresh crepe and instructed be to put the cold cooked bananas on top. I asked him to please heat up the bananas, but he insisted this is how it is served. So I had a hot crepe topped with cold fruit- not a good mix.\\n   My boyfriend and I became friendly with 4 members of our new, extended family and they too were also dissatisfied with the quality of the food. We agreed the buffet should cost $50 a person at tops, not the $85 we just paid. They came to this buffet because of how highly rated it was on Yelp. They said they were going to go back to their rooms and open Yelp accounts just to warn people about the buffet.\",\n",
       " 'I\\'ll start by saying the food here was fine. However, I didn\\'t enjoy my meal and felt that I didn\\'t get a good value. The day before, I ate at Crave which is another buffet in Vegas. Nothing I had at Bacchanal was as good as Crave and that definitely includes the services of the staff. Indeed, service was the #1 issue here at Bacchanal. We purchased VIP tickets but we observed people in the general admission getting served first. After paying, they stuck us in the same line to be seated at general admission. I felt that I had been cheated on paying for VIP. We waited and waited in the line for parties of 2 while parties of 3 and more came and went. Still we waited. I was thinking \"Wow. They must really be full. This line hasn\\'t budged for 10 minutes.\" Finally we get seated and I see about 40 empty tables. Why did they keep us standing like cattle when there were so many tables available? Regardless, I\\'ll take the less expensive Crave over Bacchanal any day.',\n",
       " \"One of my worst experiences in Las Vegas. We came for brunch expecting a good morning. After being seating and grabbing food we started to eat and were dying of thirst because drinks took about 8 minutes. \\nAll the food is super salty. The pork dumplings tasted very processed and store bought. \\nPancakes were dried out and crunchy around the edges. \\nThai curry chicken was very bland and couldn't taste much curry. \\nThe worst part was going to grab food and when coming back the plates are still all over the table and you have no room to place dishes.\",\n",

For my current trip, it was the only thing on my list that I had to hit up.\\n\\nWe arrived at about 7pm on a Thursday night. The line was fairly large but it was actually fast moving and we were seated within 15 minutes. I saw that they have a machine to add your name to the wait list, if the line is extremely long. So that's kind of nice that you don't have to wait around if it's a large wait. The cost for dinner on a non weekend night is $54.99.\\n\\nWe were initially very impressed with the huge selection of food. The choices are great, and there were all sorts of things to try. We saw pastas, tacos, pizza, chinese, sushi, an impressive carving station, large assortments of bread, charcuterie, a massive dessert area and the pièce de résistance, the seafood station. Oh yes. I was very impressed there were things I hadn't seen at a buffet before such as bone marrow, escargot, oyster shots.. pretty cool!\\n\\nBeing from Vancouver, I have access to an incredible variety of food. We have phenomenal pasta, pizza, sushi, a HUGE selection of great chinese, and we even have access to seafood buffets. My favorite being a seafood buffet under $25 about an hour from Vancouver, located in Washington state. Being a bit of a foodie, I was so excited to try out all my favorites at once place! \\n\\nI skipped the Chinese and Japanese. I can get that at home and am not a newb to buffets. I'm here for the good stuff. Meat and seafood. \\n\\nI was sorely disappointed. The oysters were pacific oysters. Cheap, fairly tasteless and nothing exciting. There were some king crab legs but to be honest, it was a lot of work as they were small and offered little meat. And if you weren't quick, the king crab legs were taken, and what was left on the plate was the other variety of crab legs (even more work to get meat). My spouse had the octopus, and was disappointed with how overdone it was. He had to spit it out.\\n\\nThe meat was alright I guess. I've had better at cheaper buffets. I was super excited to see American Wagyu beef offered along with prime rib roast and bacon at the carving station. The bacon was great, typical bacon. Nothing to screw up there. I asked for the Wagyu beef, while my spouse asked for the prime rib roast. We got the same thing. Alright. Well, whatever it was, it was overdone. It was tough, chewy and flavorless. I did not eat the whole piece offered. \\n\\nI didn't eat the pizza myself, though my spouse did. From just looking at it, I asked if he was sure he wanted one as it looked like it had been sitting out for some time. He said it tasted the same. \\n\\nI tried the bone marrow. It was overdone. \\n\\nWe spent our entire time at the table, talking about how terrible the food was. We gave the dessert table a shot, hoping we could fill up on that before leaving. The ice cream was good, hard to screw that up. I tried the flan, tiramisu, creme brulee and macarons. The flan and creme brulee were good. Nothing special but acceptable. Tiramisu was not really tiramisu but it tasted pretty good. It had the flavors of tiramisu, was just assembled differently. I was particularly excited to see macarons offered. In addition to being a foodie and eating out, I also enjoy cooking at home and baking. I bake macarons and have had some moderate success. These things are not easy to make. On initial bite, I was impressed with how fluffy the cookies were. There could have been a little more filling but it rivaled the cookies I buy for $3 each at home. Not bad. Then I tried the next macaron, and it tasted like it was 3 days expired. It was incredibly chewy and I had to spit it out. I had 2 more flavors, and had one that was acceptable and one that was old as well. \\n\\nThe macarons basically summed up our experience. This experience was hit and miss. The food is acceptable. You do get a choice of a wide variety of food, and I could see this being particularly great for someone who doesn't get a wide variety of choices at home. If you do have access to these kinds of food at home and have a quality to compare to, you will be disappointed. It will not live up to what you are expecting and used to. \\n\\nIt was an experience to try, and I'm happy I did. But I will not being returning in the future.\",\n",
       " 'EPIC DISAPPOINTMENT & COLLOSAL WASTE OF TIME!  As a frequent user of Yelp to guide our restaurant choices, I am left baffled by the rave reviews on this place.  The process to get to the buffet was a MAJOR PROCESS  -  we arrived around 5:20pm put our name in the kiosk, it gives you a ticket which tells you to come back at 7:22pm.  We went and killed two hours and returned only so the greeter could lift the velvet rope and have us stand in line for 40 minutes to pay $125 for two ppl......and here\\'s the \"piece de resistance\".....after paying you go and stand in yet ANOTHER line to be seated (another 20 minutes).  OFFENSIVE/ABSURD in my book when you are paying $58 per person.  We should have left at the onset when it was a 2 hr wait but we kept hearing how this was the best buffet in LV.   Bigger isn\\'t always better folks and this was the case at Bacchanal.  Overall, the food was mediocre/generic and made me REGRET having wasted so much time (and $$$$) so i could be served fried chicken, dried sliders, corn, brick hard meatballs and standard asian fare and low quality desserts.  Yes, they had seafood but you can find this any many other places.  If you\\'re looking for a high quality buffet with an elegant atmosphere and not having to stand in lines for hours and then more lines at the buffet - take yourselves to the Wynn Hotel where you will have a much better experience!',\n",

       " 'I had a 50th Birthday celebration for my mother in Las Vegas and planned a dinner for a total of 20 people, and this buffet was the one I chose. I had emailed the guest services and they had forwarded me to the City Wide Restaurant Group Sales. I was given a quote for my event, and even ordered a specialty cake through the baker. \\nI was quoted for each adult attendee a price of $68.99, and per child $26.99. They gave me a maximum of two hours for my event of 20 people (children and elderly included), and anything over that time frame would be an additional $500 per half hour. I also ordered a specialty cake (pictures below) that cost me a total of $340.00. I also already knew that I would be charged gratuity for my large party which I was more than comfortable with as this is done anywhere you go with a large group. The actual price for an adult dinner is $53.99... RIPPED OFF and I didn\\'t even know it until I saw the prices when I arrived.\\nWhen I arrived to the location I checked in as advised, waited about ten minutes, and we were brought to our table. There was no line outside for regular check in which I was surprised about being that it was a Saturday night in Vegas. We were taken to our tables in the back of the restaurant and separated into two round tables. Had I known I was going to have to separate my party into two round tables, I would have never came here. They had plenty of long tables that they could have put together to have the entire party I was with sit together. There were also 4 other large tables in this area that were seated in our section. We were all seated and greeted by our one server and drink requests were taken.\\n The first round of food has been completed and the plates on the tables have stacked up at this point, no waiter around refilling drinks and no place for anyone to get any more food without making the tables completely cluttered. I couldn\\'t believe that they would stick ONE waiter for a large party like mine, let alone ONE waiter for the entire back area of SIX tables. It was frustrating that it was a mess, that my guests were unable to get refills when they were empty and I felt bad for the waiter mostly. Sitting around waiting for the tables to be cleaned and refills takes time out of my two hour window.\\nHalf way through dinner my brother decides to take my niece to the dessert section to check out all that they had and let me just begin by saying WOW. The cake I ordered was a SURPRISE, the staff knew this, the lady at the group sales knew this, all my guests knew this. My brother returns to ask me if I had seen the cake I ordered...my response was no. He told me that the cake is sitting out at the dessert section in plain view, and is GREEN!!!! I went over to check the cake out and indeed it was green and in plain view. Low and behold my mother walks up and sees the cake that was supposed to be a surprise. A complete disaster. I spoke with the Manager and told him I would not be paying for this cake as it is not what we agreed on. I spent 45 min dealing with this cake situation, as my guests are sitting and waiting for the cake to be brought out all in the 2 hour time frame we are allowed. The surprise was ruined, the cake was ruined, and the entire event at this point went to crap. When the cake finally came out, we were given a knife and the cake. We asked for plates and they gave us HOT plates. I then proceeded to the dessert section to gather cold plates myself, and the manager was upset that I had to do this myself. We cut our own cake and served our own cake as there was no assistance.\\nLong story short, I was over charged per person $15 for an hour prior to the event that I was not told about, yet I could not stay an extra 30 min without being charged to accommodate the small children and elderly people in my party. My guests and I wasted 45 min of our time waiting on a cake that was a complete disaster. They decided to reimburse me for the cake and throw in 2 buffet passes for my next visit. Do they really think that I will ever return to this buffet, that my guests who spent hundreds of dollars to fly out and spend the weekend in Vegas will return to their buffet? This is a large company that should pride themselves on the service they provide, on the bakery they have and on the way they handle a situation that is brought to their attention.\\nWhen I emailed regarding the overcharge, she simply stated that\\'s what you pay when we have to hold your table prior to your arrival. When I asked her other questions she disregarded them and didn\\'t answer. When I was finally able to get in touch with her manager, her response was \"What do you feel is fair\"? I decided to stop talking to this inconsiderate people, and write a review on Yelp to allow others to make an informed decision on their next party they decide to throw.',\n",

       " 'I would give zero stars if I could. The customer service here SUCKS!  \\n\\nDuring Thanksgiving weekend of last year, we waited 4.5 hours for the buffet and paid $50 to experience bad customer service, so so food and for our dream to be shattered when they said they ran out of Alaskan King crab... although the sign for the Alaskan King crab was still out but it was only snow crab legs out for grabs. My husband and I felt cheated.  A big name buffet trying to pass off snow crab for Alaskan King crab?  We waited for 4.5 hour for the Alaskan King crab legs and I had asked them repeatedly to make sure that they have it while we were waiting in the long line. After dinner, we tried to speak to a manager and the guy brushed us off and told us to speak with the hostess. And all the hostess did was handed us a complaint form.  Hubby took time to fill it out and explain our disappointment but months had passed and no word from them.\\n\\nSo, I was in Vegas last weekend again. We stopped by Bacchanal to follow-up to see what happened with our complaint. Apparently, it never got to the manager to review.  Steve the manager said he couldn\\'t do anything about it now. After voicing my concerns and being super pissed off, he offered line passes. What good does a line pass do when the line was only 10 minutes long that day????  The idiot just kept saying \"sorry there\\'s no way we can track down the form and there\\'s nothing I can do about it now.\" Geez, well, what good does it do when no one responds to the complaint forms? So, I filled out another one on the spot to see what would happened. And guess what, a week has gone by... and STILL NO WORD FROM THEM.  Clearly they don\\'t want our business. \\n\\nBottom line is, the food tastes ok, it\\'s overpriced and there\\'s zero customer service. i\\'m soooo disappointed in Caesars.',\n",
       " 'As we were brought to our table we were told where everything was and I was excited about all the choices.\\n\\nFirst, I went to the seafood area and chose the shrimp, roasted red pepper bisque, and the miso glazed cod. The plump shrimp was the best of the 3 but with the shrimp being straight on the ice it tasted soft and semi water logged. The roasted red pepper bisque was flavorless and tasted more like a tomato soup. The miso glazed cod was cooked well but was luke warm and the wasabi mashed potatoes accompanying it were also luke warm which made the outer layer hard. Next, I went to the italian station and got the meatballs which were nicely presented and the penne carbonara. The meatball tasted fine but the tomato sauce was overly sweet and made the entire dish taste artificial. The carbonara tasted nothing like a carbonara, pasta was overcooked and it reminded me of the quality of pasta I would have tasted from a Souplantation. A few more low points were the sashimi being warm; pretzel rolls being dry; corn chowder crusty on top from it being luke warm; brisket more fat than meat. The one positive thing I will say is that this buffet has solid and well done desserts. I had the carrot cake; beignet; churro; strawberry cheesecake ice cream; mint chip ice cream; cheesecake pop; chocolate ganache log; oreo chocolate mousse. Carrot cake was moist and cream cheese frosting on top was nicely done. Beignet was also nicely done with it being freshly fried and warm. Churro was tasty but was more soft than crispy. Chocolate ganache log was my favorite; you could tell the chocolate was of high quality. \\n\\nOverall, I was very disappointed in the quality and execution of the food especially the hot items. The only reason I am even giving Baccchanal 2 stars is for the thoughtful/tasty dessert items.',\n",

It costs $69.99 since the holidays but nothing special its just the regular ol' same menu. There is so many damn people in the restaurant they are literally pushing and shoving to get food onto their plate. I did see some swinging arms and yelling, people were dropping glasses and just walking away. It was straight chaos for a Christmas dinner. \\n\\nThis place has a 2 hour limit. So if you get seated at 10:30 you will be ONLY ABLE TO EAT FOR 30 MINS. $69.99 for 30 Min buffet? NO THANK YOU. I'd rather head myself over to a nice steak restaurant and order a plate for that same price. They simply could have told the customers that have been standing in line for 3-5 fucking hours that they close at 11 so if you wait it is your responsibility. A simple nice notification or even a sign would have worked but no. They kept taking money and putting people in even at 10 o'clock, 10:30 o'clock and of course just because they take your money it doesn't guarantee you will be seated and have a meal. The whole staff is just money driven crazy and only cares about taking the customers money rather than actually serving the customers and providing nice warm meals to them. \\n\\nThe management service is HORRIBLE and some staff should not work there. straight up.\\nWe asked 4 different waitresses for our help and even though they all heard us they ignored us and went straight to the back to the employees area. The food was just like any other buffets but just simply had a nicer plating. The ramen was basically still raw and hard, the food was dry and cold from sitting for couple of hours. \\n\\nI'm guessing that the reason that they were rated as #1 buffer in Las Vegas for 2016 is probably because they made the rater wait so freaking long whatever they serve is going to be damn right delicious. \\n\\nI don't know, maybe I am the dumb one who made the mistake of going to this restaurant on Christmas? But from what I know, good restaurants simply do not have bad days because of some holidays. Real good restaurants are consistent throughout what comes in their way. \\nThis hotel Caesars Palace and this buffet in general, not a good service or good experience. I would never go here again or stay at this hotel again. Sorry to you Sir. Julius Caesar. They are disgracing your name. \\n*save your money folks their is much better buffets in Vegas with much better service.*\",\n",

The first time I came here, I waited an hour in line and then ended up leaving when I found out the line was another 2 hours...ugh. This past time, I was happy to see that you could get a slip of paper with a time to come back so you could go do other things for awhile and come back. Great idea! We came back 90 min later... only to find out that there were 2 more lines to wait in. Seriously?!?! Why even have the paper? Just call me when you are actually ready. We waited another 45 min or so to pay ( a ridic 65$ ish with a prepaid tip) and be seated. Why? They kept letting people ahead who paid to skip the line. That is ridiculous and infuriating. Anyway, when we finally got in, we were overwhelmed by the amount of food there. It was a ton. Unfortunately, pretty much none of it was good. There was one dumpling I got that was good, but upon returning, they didn't have anymore. Tried to ask of they had more and the man behind the counter claimed a different dumpling was it (not the case, clearly...one was shrimp one was pork). The pastas were all disappointing...flavorless..boring. The pho was ok, but the ramen was gross. The lamb chops were way underdone...super red...ew. Poor lambs. The seafood was overly fishy...not too fresh. The Mexican food was awful... my friend actually spit it out. The only good items were the mac and cheese, the cheese (duh), and the yellow curry. The desserts were a joke...flavorless again. The service was awful. We never got a refill on our drinks. Plates sat on our table ready to be cleared for a long time.

Sushi quality wasn't that bad, but it could have have more variety of different fishes. Ramen soup was filled with so much salt, it was not for drinking standards and probably more to dip the noodles. Pho was the best dish at the noodles section and better if you put those cut green chili from the side into the soup.\\n\\nSeafood selections were few and yet quality was low. The oysters were of a dubious color, and cold crab legs might have been very fresh since it tasted like salt water.\\n\\nDidn't try much hot food since nothing seemed appetizing enough to make it to my plate. The meat section's beef prime rib was the best dish of the night.\\n\\nDessert looked like a party, yet only the cheesecake was palatable. Other cakes were too hard and dry, even the molten lava cake which was warm, was no molten. Crepe was kinda like uncooked flour with no taste whatsoever, even the Nutella topping couldn't save it.\\n\\nOverall not worth going to, and lucky for our group, we reached a lil before 5 and didn't have to queue for more than 10 mins.

The crabs (at both hot and cold sections) were super salted, this was probably a mean to discourage us from eating too much. You should not anyway because this is very unhealthy. The salmon smells ... fishy of course. The only saving grace was the tacos, they were surprisingly good. Deserts were also not worth eating.

Most of the lunch items were there and the only notable additions were the raw oysters and new batch of nigiri. The oysters were tasteless unless you spritz a little lemon to heighten the flavor (sad). Overall, I felt bad for anyone that came after 3p, because it was almost the same food as lunch. \\n\\nThe desserts were also sorely disappointing. I didn't think any of the various desserts made it past the first bite except for the delicious crème brûlée.

We went on Mother's Day, were charged an arm and a leg, when they ran out of a lot of things, and found out they weren't serving lamb chops(which is one of the best things on the menu).  Today we decided to try it again and were very disappointed.  Again, no lamb chops, this time, they ran out of crème brulee, they didn't have the variety of veggies they normally have, no ravioli in lobster sauce, so basically there were only a few items that I found that were tasty.  We were also told multiple times that the lamp chops would be ready at 3p and an hour later, still no lamb chops and it turned out they weren't serving lamb chops, so basically waited for nothing.  It would be understandable if they raised prices and kept the food quality the same, but when you raise prices and the food goes down, that's a really bad combo.

With this price, I think we should lift the bar a little bit higher if we are honest. However, I soon determined that you actually don\\'t need high standard to classify Bacchanal Buffet to be poor. My first question was \"Where are the hundreds of selections as said by some reviews?\" Their selection is actually quite limited, at least much less than the buffet at M Casino or Rio Casino in Las Vegas.\\n\\nIf seafood is considered to be superb at Bacchanal, then where is lobster? And where is sashimi? You see none of these, but they dare to display several lobsters right at the front of the restaurant in a glass container to fool people. If they don\\'t serve lobsters, this kind of act is evidently unethical, sort of misleading, misrepresented, and even cheating. \\n\\nThe night I went was on Saturday, March 12th, and I had tasteless prime rib, over salty beef rib, rock-hard lamb chop, warm-to-cold Asian watery rice (Congee), and clumsily chopped BBQ pork. Evidently, Bacchanal\\'s food could  be claimed to be good only by those who seldom had quality or fine food and probably happened to be at Bacchanal to try an expensive food for the first time in their lives. If you\\'re a bit more familiar with Las Vegas, you easily can find another buffet of much better quality with much less price at some other casinos of the same Caesars group in Las Vegas such as Planet Hollywood or Flamingo. \\n\\nIf you went to the same Bacchanal as I did, can you show me where their wide range of selected fruit is? Why could I only see some dull-white watermelon, sour-no-sweet pineapple, grainy cantaloupe, and nothing else? \\n\\nBy paying the pricy charge, I thought I should\\'ve been served with some finely prepared food there but honestly speaking, I didn\\'t see any dishes that can be labeled as exquisite ones. Nevertheless, I did see arrays of pizza, taco,French fries, fried sweet potatoes, poorly layered mini-hamburger, simply stuffed mini-hotdog, heavily soy-sauced fried rice, over-oily fried noodles, and so on --- those common, cheap, mediocre and inauthentic items.      \\n\\nBesides being deeply disappointed by their food quality and food selection, I was also deeply amazed by the poor service rendered by their cashiers, ushers, some waiters and waitresses, some bus boys, and most of food servers behind the counters. They all looked so grumpy and most were arrogant to customers.',\n",

After signing a contract and believing I had the best experience of my life I was slammed 10 days later with an unknown $3,000 charge. When I tried calling the Bacchanal it took them days to get back to me. They first claimed that I had a table outside of our groups private room that resulted in me having over 10 more people than I actually had and that\\'s what the charge was for. When I asked who made the head count they admitted there was no head count taken but they counted the number of chairs that were in the room... last I checked chairs were inanimate objects that didn\\'t eat food so I don\\'t know why they would base my head count off of chairs and not actual people. They never sent me any kind of invoice when the charge occurred, then when I finally got a hold of someone over the phone that was actually part of Bacchanal management I was told that they were willing to give me a \"discount\" of 3 people for the mysterious 10 people that they wrongfully charged me for. I of course did not accept. The last I heard they would be having a meeting about it and get back to me within 1-4 days. That was over 2 months ago. Very disappointed with the unprofessional behavior I experienced from upper management. I even requested that video camera footage be pulled of my group walking back so a head count could be performed by their management... conveniently they delete all of their video footage every 7 days.',\n",
       " \"We were very excited to splurge on a buffet for our last morning in town. We decided to go in the morning about 10 on a Thursday and I'm wondering if this was the issue? The place was sort of slow, no line, some empty tables so maybe the turn over for food wasn't so high. So many things such as the pancakes, French toast and cute waffle/fried chicken baskets etc were crispy and dried out from sitting under the warmer lights too long. The prime rib was the worst I've had! I don't get to eat it too often and it was SO dry and tasteless. Maybe just the end where mine was served? The sushi looked a little sad as well as the salads( fruit and veggie), both were lacking color and looked as if prepared the previous day. Positives: good service, juices, gelato, Creme brûlée was fantastic. We were pretty disappointed as we had saved up our appetites and spent good money to go.

So, here comes the bad stuff:\\n\\nAs much as the food choices were diverse, I am not sure if the preparation was up to par. First off, tell me why some of the food was bland?

We came here for our wedding anniversary, so we indicated this when we entered in our information on the reservation kiosks, but nothing else after that (with the exception of them taking your picture before they seat you, then they attempt to sell you those pictures).

My most recent visit will probably be my last!\\n\\nWhen this place first opened few years ago, the food was amazing, the variety was outstanding, and even the presentation of the food was novel and wonderful and always brought a smile to my face.\\n\\nOver the years , the food and the selection remained good enough to keep me coming back, but I definitely had noticed it slowly declining.  Now though, the experience itself has gotten so bad that I'm not sure I'll ever be back.\\n\\nWe went at 6pm on a Monday night.  The wait was 40 minutes to get in, but that was really ok; I pretty much expect that.  But this time, once we were inside there were more lines to wait on.  The seafood area, and carving board area both had huge lines.  In the past, there might be a slight wait before one could get through these areas, but on this night there was a loooong wait for both, which was very unpleasant.  Not only that, there were people that would get to the head of the line and then have friends and family members (that had NOT waited on line) come up with their empty plates, and would then fill those plates.  It was if mom was in her own kitchen serving her family members.  This of course added to the wait for the rest of us.\\n\\nIn addition, the service was awful.  In the past, the servers cleared plates quickly, were attentive, and refreshed drinks and water quickly, and would check as one started in on dessert and then offer coffee or whatever.  On this particular night, our plates piled up and were infrequently cleared.  Although, I did find a soda had been refreshed at one point while I was away from the table, I was never able to get my water refilled once, even though I had consumed the first glass upon arrival.  I also could never flag down someone to get coffee. And finally at one point, I realized that the table that was right next to us (very close), had been vacated by diners and then became the dumping ground where servers piled up dirty dishes.  Every inch was filled, and the pile was easily a foot high.  Not very pleasant.\\n\\nI would say that the food is still fairly good, but the overall experience makes it NOT worth the price.  I'm wondering if it's just because they're letting in too many people at once.  I'm not sure this is the case, but my perception is that in the past, they controlled entry so that there were less people inside at once.  That would certainly make the individual food lines more reasonable, and give the poor overworked servers a chance to be able to keep up, and make for a MUCH better customer experience.\\n\\nIt is very expensive for a buffet, and I have come to the conclusion that my (same amount of) money would be better spent at one of the many, many Vegas restaurants where I would not waIt on line after line, enjoy a great meal, have attentive service and have a more civilized experience.\",\n",

       " 'HOLIDAY/CHRISTMAS DINNER REVIEW\\n\\nI can\\'t believe we spent almost an entire day (Christmas Day!) at Caesar\\'s Palace waiting for Bacchanal Buffet. \\n\\nOk, to be fair- we got there early (~10:30AM) and got an early ticket of 12:00PM (!!) to come back. We had actually anticipated a worse wait (we didn\\'t know that we\\'d be coming back at 12:00PM to line up...) so we decided to cancel (what a mistake that was) and try to go closer to 3-4PM. So we decided to try again- got a ticket at 10:50AM for my friend (return time: 1:04PM) and then again at 11:20AM for a return time of 3:25PM (crazy how much a 30 min difference can make). We came back at 3:25PM and entered the queue, and we ended up waiting an additional 2.5 hours before we got seated around 6PM. (Some people who mistakenly got in the queue without a ticket at 3:30PM got tickets that told them to come back at 10PM... Which is when the buffet closes. Just to give you an idea of how bad the line was).\\n\\nMy main criticism is that they don\\'t put any effort in clarifying how the process works for this particular buffet. For most buffets, people show up, people enter the queue, and expect to wait a certain amount and eat when they make it through the queue. For Bacchanal, you line up for an electronic kiosk, then get an electronic ticket telling you to come back at a certain time, THEN you queue up, THEN you pay and get seated. Somewhere in that process, someone is supposed to check off on your ticket but I did not observe any consistent check-in process (my sister walked up to the lady to check-in separately). There are no banner of any sort explaining this process so you also end up having a number of people just entering the queue and facing the bouncer-type guy who asks to see their ticket. Or they\\'re never confronted and actually make it through the line. \\n\\n(PS: If the electronic kiosk does not give you a physical ticket, try to go into another kiosk and get one. On the physical ticket, it states that you MUST present your ticket in order to enter the queue.)\\n\\nBy the way, apparently some people were asking if they could pay extra to get to the front of the line. They were told that this would not possible on that day. (Seriously, is this a common practice at buffets? SERIOUSLY?)\\n\\nNow onto the service and the food. Our poor waitress was definitely tried and showing it. She was lugging stacks of plates- their plates are really heavy. We were stacking a few plates to make more room but two/three plates were quite heavy! She warmed up to us a lot after we complimented her strength and asked her how she was doing- basically showing patience and not being rude/impatient. \\n\\nFood-wise- pretty decent but nothing that justified the $70+tax/person price for the holiday buffet. Yes, they had unlimited crab legs (my parents said they were ok). Yes, they had unlimited raw oysters (not even properly shucked, btw- I had to use my fork to actual separate the oyster from shell). Yes they had bone marrow (it was ok) and a ton of other items. But most of the food was just ok, and after a long wait and high price, \"ok\" was not adequate. I will say my favorite item was probably the wild mushroom soup, but other than that I can\\'t even think about what else stood out. The dessert section was extensive: I did like that they had a Thai tea boba drink. The boba was surprisingly soft and the taste was pretty faithful for a non-Asian restaurant. \\n\\nOverall, not worth the wait, not worth the price, and not worth the confusion that their system generates. 1/5.',\n",
       " 'I was super excited to eat at this buffet after reading all the positive reviews. Upon arrival, the buffet looked liked it held a lot of potential.  The new 17million dollar space was artsy and beautiful with loud music which made it feel trendy and hip.  The light fixtures made out ornate objects like water glass and vases made the space feel eclectic.  The staff was really attentive to my needs with refills on drinks and clearing plates off the table, even pausing for a little casual chit chat.  \\n\\nI walked up down all the different stations to scope out which dishes I had to try and which to pass on. The food spread seemed to go on forever ranging from seafood, Italian, Mexican, and Asian.  It was like a kid in a candy store. Tons of choices but all unfortunately not to my liking.\\n\\nI decided that the salad bar would have to be missed in order to try everything else. I started at the Asian station. They had a noodle soup station where you could even get pho. I had dumplings, egg rolls, and Korean short ribs, which were okay but nothing special.  The ribs had good flavor but where a bit chewy.\\n\\nMoved to the Italian station next, where different pastas and pizzas were prepared.  The  best part of this station was the charcuterie station with all the different meats, cheeses, and mustards.\\n\\nNext station up was the American BBQ.  This looked like the perfect all American BBQ spread...all the BBQ meats one could ever ask for from ribs to brisket, chicken, and lamb chops with all the best fixing available. Mac\\'n cheese, broccoli with cheese, mash potatoes, corn, and tator tots.  The ribs that I tasted were so chewy, I couldn\\'t even cut them apart with my knife and the flavor tasted like gasoline...no smokiness or fall apart goodness.\\n\\nThe Mexican station had a woman making fresh tortillas and a bunch of different salsa choices to accompany the meal.\\n\\nLast of the savory stations is the seafood station.  They had lobster, corn chowder, crab croquette, as well as, hot and cold crab legs, shrimp, and raw oyster...all too salty to eat.  \\n\\nThen came dessert.  I had heard about the fresh out of the oven souffles that they offered and the wide variety of gelato and sorbets.  Tonight they had banana and pistachio flavored souffles.  The pistachio souffle came out of the oven piping and tall, but had no flavor...all that could be tasted was raw flour.  The gelato station was the only place actually lived up the buffet\\'s claim of thinking \"out of the box\" and unique. I tried a fig & balsamic, watermelon & mint, blood orange, and mango chili lime, which was my favorite out the 4 flavors. \\n\\nOverall, the food was too pricey at $44.99 for dinner and too salty for my taste...will probably never go back.',\n",

All the seafood was not fresh (to the point that I didn\\'t even try the oysters -- didn\\'t think it\\'d be safe). The crab legs were dry and the meat was completely tasteless. \\n\\nAfter a highly highly disappointing dining experience, my friends and I just decided to load up on dessert to make up for the nasty food. To our disappointment, even the dessert was bad...!

First, some of the items appeared to be stale or leftovers.  Second, the selection wasn't spectacular.  Even what I heard was one of the must try options (red velvet pancakes) was meh, ok.  For this price, my expectations are higher.  While I will return for dinner again, I will never ever have the breakfast there.  It's simply not that great, and not worth it.\",\n",
       " \"Don't believe the hype! \\n\\nWe came here for brunch after reading yelp reviews and seeing the long lines. The price for brunch is nearly $50 per person after tax and it's really not worth it. Rumors of macarons and delicious food were false. Maybe true for dinner or some other sitting times but definitely not for brunch. The food was underseasoned and tasteless. The sushi bar was disappointing. The dessert bar was either bland or bland, with the exception of the green tea creme brûlée which was excellent. But still not enough to carry the price of the meal. \\n\\nIf you can eat your weights worth of Alaskan crab legs, then this is the place for you. They offer hot or cold legs that are split in half for easy consumption. It does have a large variety but a lot of tasteless food or salty food is worst than grabbing a quick bite at McDonald's.\\n\\nPeople come to Vegas for the buffets as well as the shows and the gambling.

Yes it was pricey but I loveD this buffet (notice the D) so I didn't care. \\nAnyway I finish my first plate and go for my second which was a make your own omlette and as I'm eating my food I notice a hair in the omlette. Biggest mood ruiner ever. I notify the waitress and she says shell call the manager. We literally wait 15-20 minutes for the manager to show up to our table. I've had hair in my food before at other restaurants, but when that happens the manager comes over in a heart beat to show their concern and make matters better. The fact that she came so late showed how insignificant it was. \\nAnyway she came. I explained what happened. And she took my plate to find the hair and took a pic of it. Then she offered to make me another omlette . Really? Who wouldn't lose their appetite after seeing that? So I decline.  Then she offers me coffee. I decline also. \\nThen finally she's like okay we'll see if we can give you a discount. She proceeds to take my receipt and after 10 minutes she comes back. She ends up taking 20 dollars off. \\nIs that even a real thing? Why wasn't my meal comped? I didn't even get to eat as much as I paid for. It ruined my appetite. I honestly wouldn't have expected a place of this high quality to show such lack of consideration and honestly common sense to their customers. \\nFinding hair in food happens unfortunately but it's how the restaurant and management decides to deal with the matter that counts. Had she shown more care and dealt with it in a better manner I wouldn't even be writing this review. I loved bacchanal man. It's the only restaurant I look forward to when I go to Vegas. Now it's tainted. I feel like I can't go back because I'm still so pissed.\",\n",
       " \"Holy moly!  We waited in line for an hour and 45 minutes.  The only thing that was getting me through that wait was the thought of ayce king crab legs!  We finally made it in around 9pm and they only had snow crab and stone crab!  What happened to the king crab???  Fine, I had snow crab and it was just okay.  I wandered around to see what they offered and I must say that it was all about presentation.  The fried chicken, tater tots, fish & chips were offered in little wire fry baskets.  Each slider was placed on its own little ceramic dish.  Oh, and they have street vendor food -- corn on the cob slathered with mayo and crumbly cheese (where's the paletas??). They also have a charcuterie along with different types of cheeses.  I was excited about that.  I wanted to order wine with the meats and cheeses and found out it is not possible to order one glass of wine.  If you want wine, you have to order all-you-can-drink wine for $15.99 (on top of the $39.99 you just paid for dinner).  Anyway, we were a party of 6 and we tried everything.  A lot of the items were really salty so we needed a lot of water.  (Maybe they do this on purpose so you get full on water and don't each so much??  Guess they gotta recoup that $18MM somehow...).  For a buffet, the presentation is great, but the food is mediocre.  If you like to see your food sitting in something pretty, eat here.  If you want good food, go to the M.\",\n",

       " \"Of course I was expecting something grand after I read reviews about it online and asked around about it but It was a complete disappointment. It felt very unorganised and I am unsatisfied with the service. We put our name down on the kiosks provided at 8:30pm for dinner, it was roughly a 30min wait time through the online system, which was fine as the casino is a place worth exploring. When we first got the text we assumed we would get a table instantly or maybe within a couple of minutes of being there, however we had to queue up to pay first and mind you the queue was not a quick one. After paying the cashier at the counter told us the restaurant closes at 10:30pm which we thought would be fine, if we just came in and ate straight away BUT yet again there was a queue.... by the time we started queueing up it was already nearing 10. Absolutely terrible ! \\nIt was frustrating, staff were like machines. By the time 10pm rolled around there was still a line of people waiting to eat. When we finally got a seat, we asked one of the staff members about closing time and they said that they would push the close time to about 10:45pm as it was still busy. We haven't eaten since lunch and we couldn't wait to dig into the food. Imagine our disappointment when the food was just bland, tasteless and dry. The waitresses and chefs behind the bar were not happy to be there, and the mood in the restaurant seemed more like a fast food setting; get in and get out. Not worth the hype, very long wait times and way too expensive for the food they were serving. The food wasn't exceptionally great for the price, it just looks visually appealing. The only reason why I didn't give it a one star rating is because I've had worse food at a buffet, but it was dirt cheap. You get what you pay for and I certainly didn't get what I paid for.\",\n",

They stopped offering the fun Mexican drinks in the little bottles. Sure they have oysters and crab legs but I've been to other buffets that offer that and aren't as expensive. The desserts are not as impressive as they used to be. Bachannal Buffet has lost its appeal. Time to find a new Vegas buffet.\",\n",

This entire area is a giant fail by the marketing department. There are no prices listed for the buffet. There are no prices listed for the special 24 hour buffet pass. People are getting to the cashier, which at 1pm on a Saturday, there is only one cashier, one cashier - and they are walking away at the ridiculous prices! Caesars, put up marketing materials, tell us how much the buffet costs. I was at wicked spoon and they tell you everything before you stand in line. Tell us the $15 line pass is per person. Tell us that if you come back the next morning, you'll have to pay another $15 to not wait in the line after you've already spent $65 a person plus tax and tip. Well after complaining to the manager, we finally sat down for the buffet. I liked the buffet, the food was tasty. I didn't overeat or go overboard because I was saving my appetite for my birthday dinner. Well, a few hours later, I'm gambling at the Wynn and it hit me. I got really sick to my stomach.

One of my biggest complaints is a general one about most Vegas casinos and hotels now which is the parking fees. One of the benefits of visiting Vegas in the past was being able to go from casino to casino without paying for parking.

Basically, if you're curious about the hype, waste your money and go check it out but if you're looking for a good buffet that won't break the bank, may I recommend the buffet at Mandalay Bay which in my opinion is the best value for money buffet in Vegas and at almost half the cost.\",\n",
       " \"I was so excited to try this new buffet in Caesars Palace.  Usually the restaurants in Caesars is good but my experience at Bacchanal was just awful.  I came Sunday night at around 6pm.  I waited in line and was finally seated after an hour.  I checked the carving station and all they had was brisket, ribs, and some sausage.  No prime rib....how disappointing!  I thought that was a staple at all the good buffets on the strip.  The meat was DRY.  It was just not good at all.  I went on to try the nigiri and sushi.  The rice was mooshie and the fish was not fresh.  I also had a cute tiny bucket of mussels.  The mussels were all dried out.  I was thinking maybe it got dry from the heating lamp...but would the mussels on the bottom be dry from the lamp too?  I then tried the lobster corn chowder and that was way too salty.  I did enjoy the raw oysters and shrimp cocktail.  The dessert was good.  I liked the tarts, cheesecake pop, and macaroons.  The macaroons were a little chewy but what do you expect from a buffet?  The cupcake was dry.  I did not try the pho station (I'm from the bay area.  There is no place with better pho).  It was just a disappointing experience.  I will not be returning.  Step up your game Bacchanal.\",\n",
       " \"This place is over-rated.\\nI won't go into too much details but will pin point some areas that can be improved. \\n\\n1) King Crab legs - they looked like they are Mal-nutrition and they are kinda dirty. \\n\\n2) Small individual dishes - Yes they do look cute and all, but the problem is since the food are placed on individual dishes, it's hard to keep them warm. Most dished that I've tried are cold. \\n\\n3) A lot of the dishes are on the salty side.\\n\\n4) Service is pretty slow, we waited about 15mins to order our drinks.\\n\\n5) Salt and Pepper shakers (on the table). I've never seen a pepper shaker with holes smaller then the peppers inside. \\n\\nThe only thing we're impressed of is the desserts bar. A lot of varieties and they all look and taste good. For $44.99 on a weekday dinner, there are better buffets out there. I rather go to the Seafood buffet at Rio.\",\n",

       " 'I would have liked to review the food but that would be difficult.  We arrived at Ceasars which is difficult to navigate to begin with.  Arriving in the buffet area we are told to login and be given our time to eat.  We asked if their buffet was still included in the 24 hour deal and we were assured they were.  We waited 90 minutes to be called.  Then we were told it was an additional $30.00 per person to dine there with the 24 hour deal.  The deal was also $15.00 more than before.  So after waiting for 90 minutes we are told to eat there is going to cost 30.00 above what is paid for the buffet deal.  Totally ridiculous.  And by the way - to expedite your space you could pay $15.00 each.  And if you are handicapped - only one person may go in with you - the rest of your party can wait until they are called.',\n",

I understand it's buffet, but given the price I was expecting something at least semi-decent.  Both waygu beef and prime rib were hard to chew.  Bone marrow wasn't impressive.  Gnocchi was just bland.  Dessert wasn't better than any other buffet and the selection was worse.  \\n\\nDo yourself a favor and spend money on a nicer dinner.

We were seated all the way in the asian food section. We ask for our drinks 2 times with 2 different waiter. When we were about to be full I remember the Mimosa that was included. I ask for it and the waiter looked confused. I show him the receipt (VIP) and he said \"Oh how come, you guys are siting here.\" He came back with our Mimosa.

They didn't even serve steak so I had to settle on pork chops also that were very cheap in quality.. just the list goes on and on of just miss after miss of trying to hit the spot on quality and selection.\\n\\nThe only positive thing I can say about this place is that my greeter was very nice and gave me a quick tour of the place and the server was a very nice gentleman which I tipped him accordingly but other then that I'll never return.\",\n",

They did not even offer a steak! The most expensive thing they offer is probably the king crab at dinner time and they are served cold.\\nMy tactic was to get a little bit of everything and go back to the things I loved and I did not find anything that I really wanted more of! I'm normally really easy to please and for the price I should of left happy and stuffed! But I left not even full but disgusted of eating anymore of the mediocre food. \\nThe most enjoyable thing about my meal was probably meeting the couple who sat next to me and talking about how much we all and other people we met in line were displeased with the food. \\nService was definitely lacking. I definitely didn't eat quickly but I'd have empty plates sitting on my table for a long time and getting a server for a refill was difficult because she barely came by. \\nIf there was anything that was good about bacchanal buffet was that there was much more variety compared to the Bellagio buffet which I went to the next day. But whats the point of variety if it all so bland and mediocre.\\nIf I can suggest anything to you is to go to the Bellagio. It's cheaper and better tasting just less variety but hey, that's why you pay about $15 less.  Service was also much better.

Plus we ordered the unlimited wine for $18 and we got to only choose from their cheapest red or white. Even if i ordered two glasses of that same wine it would have come out to only $14, what a rip off!\\n\\nNext everything on there was cold as ice. We got some sliders and little baskets with fries and a chicken drumstick and it was like they came out of a refrigerator. Inedible. It was the same for everything we tried. Oh the one thing that was hot? The plates! The only saving grace was the desserts they were great, why...because they were supposed to be cold/room temperature. In comparison we went to Emeril Lagasse\\'s \"Table 10\" at the Palazzo and spent $120 on two meals, a drink and two desserts and were full and happy.

Same thing for The Chinese food station. The meat station was not great as well. But the seafood station is decent. There's a variety of seafood to choose from, e.g. lobsters, king crab legs, oysters, scallops, etc. The dessert bar has a lot to choose from as well. Truffle mushroom soup was a hit for me.

As you may have heard from previous reviews, the ticket that you receive upon reaching the restaurant does absolutely nothing for the wait time. The \"text\" that they were supposed to send to notify us of when we were supposed to be at the restaurant did not arrive and was a complete waste of time. Even though we arrived at the restaurant earlier than others to receive this ticket, those who received the ticket after us were somehow able to be seated before us, thus making the ticket very much useless. After being presented the ticket, the woman in front, as well as the ticket, very clearly stated that we were to come back at that specific time after receiving the text message to be seated. Fair enough. After wandering the streets of Las Vegas for almost 4 hours, which was apparently the wait time for the restaurant, we returned to the buffet, only to find the huge line awaiting us, not to mention that we never received any form of message from the business. Convinced that we were able to get in sooner because of the ticket, we asked the same lady in front and she just quickly pointed us to the back of the line and left. Still utterly confused, we asked around only to understand that the ticket was not a pass to be seated earlier, but just a piece of paper to show that we were eligible to get in, meaning that we still needed to wait in line to be seated. We then waited in the never-moving line for about 1.5-2 hours before finally being able to see the inside of the restaurant. It was around 9:30 or so and with still so many people behind us and the restaurant closing in about half an hour, we were at our limits. What should have been a relaxing dinner with family was rushed and uncomfortable for everyone. Technically, the time we spent waiting for the text, a thorough explanation, and the line was actually around 6 hours, which is a huge amount of time for the quality of food that was served there. Not satisfied at all. \\n\\n2. After finally being seated half an hour before the advertised closing time, we immediately went to get food, filling our plates with as much as we could take, expecting the food to be absolutely delicious, but sadly we were once again very wrong. Throughout the meal, the food was at most mediocre and most likely able to be bought at any restaurant in our home town, making us instantly regret our decision to spend more than $200 on the place. A lot of the food tasted overcooked, burnt, and almost vomit-worthy. After barely eating anything and having spent a tremendous amount of money, we just left, with still many people left eating/unseated. I would have described the food there to be leftovers from a trashy restaurant if I did not know where it actually came from, though the argument still stands. \\n\\nIt\\'s overrated and the management for crowds sucks.

I ended up wasting a lot of these because I got so many the first round, and they were gross.\\nDim Sum - 5 stars, just as good as the best in the Bay. The hao gao and shu mai were good, but the Shangheinese dumpling was the best. Super juicy. \\nHot meats - 4 stars, co-worker really, really enjoyed the lamb\\nNigiri - 4 stars, only 2 types, salmon and tuna, but both nice and fresh. The nigiri is kinda hidden away though. It's hidden in a corner and easy to miss if you're not looking for it.\\nCharcuterie - 5 stars, lots and lots of coppa and other good stuff\\nCheese - 3 stars. tillamook, really? Tillamook is good, but they could definitely improve the cheese selection. There were no soft cheeses :( \\nBeverage selection - 2 stars because there are only 2 wines by the glass. Seriously, meh. I would have loved a glass of Sauv Blanc for $7, but the bottles are $25 and  you know those are $10 at BevMo. Skip.\\nEnvironment - 4 stars. The place is brand new and designed, it's pretty and relaxing. Unfortunately due to the experience above, it took 30 minutes to relax after getting in there.

       " \"I brought my family here on a Tuesday, which was yesterday. My mother, my daughter, and I came here around 11:20 am, and saw the automated  check-in stations (machines) right in front of the line, and several people were already using them. Without a doubt we went up to the the machine on the left, and started checking us in. The results showed we had to wait for 49 minutes, and we'd get a text message when we had to come back. Behind those check in machines there was already a line going. At the entrance to that line was the hostess. I thought my 49 minute wait is the estimation to how long I'd be waiting in line, so I went up to the hostess to ask. She (I think her name was Emma) said that I had to wait 49 minutes before I could get in line, so the three of us got in the corner there and waited to be called. Less than in a minute I saw two families come up to the check in machines. The hostess rushed to those families before they could even start checking in, and told them to get in line. I came up to her, and said that it was not fair and not nice of her to treat us differently, to what she got very aggressive, and started explaining to me about some yellow lines in her computer, that the people whom she texted did not show up, and that she had to make sure the line was filled with people up to a certain area. Things she said were irrelevant. She saw us standing there, and when we went up to her the line was not full. I left with a feeling that their check in system is not effective, or the staff doesn't follow it well, or she had something against me, or the hostess lets people, who tip her get further in line.\",\n",

The server was very nice and explained how everything was laid out, which was important because the buffet is HUGE.\\n\\nThere are sections for seafood, american, mexican, italian, and asian food. So there is something for anyone, but that something is ultimately kind of bland. I started with the good ol' USA. The american section had some some sliders that were very dry. You could get a lot of carved meats (including ribs), but for the most part it was just flavorless. The chicken wings were good though, and the chicken and waffles concept (a wing in a waffle cone) was very cute. \\n\\nI thought maybe the international sections would be more exciting, but was let down. The street tacos were the highlight of the mexican section and the asian-style wings held down the asian section, but otherwise nothing was memorable. As a pasta lover, I was very disappointed the pastas were overcooked.\\n\\nOverall I think you're better off going to the Wicked Spoon or the Bellagio.\",\n",

We took her out for the circus at 2:30pm and got out at 3:45. None of us ate breakfast, because we wanted to eat in the buffet. After arrived at bacchanal，we waited in line for half an hour. Then, there was a staff suddenly showed up saying that we have to sign in before getting in the line. We didn't complain, thought she could have let everyone know that you have to get a little ticket before entering the waiting line. We did as what she told. The system shows that we have to wait till 8:50 to get into a table. Thought it was a five hour wait, we decided to go back to hotel and come back for it. After all, it was my little sister's birthday. And we want to make it special. We came back at 8:30, then informed by the manager that they were closed for the night. The waiting time was not a guarantee. Even if we could get a table at 9:30, all the food station will be shut down at 10. He especially mentioned that I should know better because tonight was suppose to be busy. What a professional thing to say! As a manger, you should know better than I do. If you expected so many people wouldn't be able to get a table, why giving out the waiting estimation first place. Or, you could at least try to inform the guest through the phone, before letting them starving for five hours! Don't blame it on the computer system. It was your problem to fix rather than the costumers'. Even worse, the male manager walked away arrogantly without even trying to apologize. This hotel should train their staffs how to treat the costumer with respect, before letting them become to the manager.  Thank u for giving my family the most memorable Las Vegas night!

       " 'Hubby and I visited Vegas during independence weekend (2017) and made plans to try bacchanal buffet. Prior to our trip, we researched all the different places we wanted to try during our trip and this place was at the VERY top of our list. \\n\\nBacchanal buffet is located inside Caesar\\'s palace and it is one of the most expensive buffets on the strip. Not to mention one of the most popular. If you don\\'t get there early enough, you will wait over 200 minutes or pay an expensive fee to \"skip the line\".\\n\\nWe arrived at 4 for dinner. Dinner is served between 3-10 I believe and from what the cashier said, the busiest times were between 6-9. Boy was she wrong. Upon arriving, we checked into the kiosk to get a place in line and the kiosk gave us a return time of 219 minutes.. around 7:30. It also gave us the option to skip the line now for $35 per person. \\n\\nBecause this was a new experience for us, we said eff-it, and paid the express fee. For my hubby and I, our total tab to enter was $227. $69 per person for dinner and $35 per person to skip the line. After paying, we were seated within 5-10 minutes. Not bad. Our hostess walked us to our table but unlike the other guests, she did not explain the different buffet sections. So, shame on her. \\n\\nUpon sitting down, we wait quite a while to get drinks ordered. We did not have a specific waiter assigned to us really. It was really chaotic and unorganized where we sat. We were seated in the Asian/Italian section at the back of the restaurant which is a VERY good section to be in. The steamed crabs is in that section and if you\\'ve ever been to bacchanal, you\\'ll know that the cold seafood section at the front of the restaurant is the most packed section. So having the steamed crabs by our table was great! No wait time. \\n\\nMy favorites from this buffet would have to be:\\n-the steam crabs\\n-the Asian soup section \\n-the roasted duck\\n-the roasted pork belly\\n-the desert and fruit section\\n-and somewhat the meat section (steaks & ribs)\\n\\nOther than that, everything else is pretty mediocre. \\nDo I think it\\'s worth $227? For first time, sure. After this? Heck no. Will I be back? Maybe. For everything I enjoyed here, I could\\'ve easily gotten anywhere else on the strip. \\n\\nReally wanted to be amazed of this place, but in reality, it was a hyped up place for me and was nothing but hype.',\n",

       " \"We are always in Vegas and decided to try the new buffet at Ceaser's. We were very disappointed. We were very happy upon arrival to see how large the buffet was, and yes they had a large selection of food. The biggest annoyance of this place was that only about 30% of the food was labeled. I have food issues so I need to know what I'm about to eat. I can't imagine I'm the only one that wants to know what kind of food they are about to consume. Of what I tried that was labeled, most of it was good. I had lobster benedict which was very tasty. My boyfriend had crab benedict and watermelon juice which he enjoyed. The pancakes however were crispy and the shrimp iny shrimp and grits was very mealy and tough. All in all I would not return simply because I like to know what I'm eating. I'll stick to Wicked Spoon down at Cosmo.\",\n",
       " \"One of the buffets I visited in Vegas. I had high hopes for this buffet, since it's been hyped up so much! I asked the cashier if they had plenty of vegan options. They asked me if I wanted to talk to one of the chefs while she shows me around the buffet, which I thought was pretty cool of them to offer. From what I saw, they did have some vegan options. So my friend and I decided to go for it and have lunch at Bacchanal. Just to try it out for the experience. \\n\\nIn my opinion, it's not the best buffet for vegans. I felt pretty limited even though they did have some vegan options. The options weren't as great compared to The Buffet at Wynn. They had veggie sushi rolls, but the rolls were sloppy-looking. We're talking about simple veggie sushi rolls here. How can anyone mess this one up? Lol. I usually like edamame beans, but the ones at Bacchanal tasted weird. They had lots of desserts, but no vegan desserts. They had fruit (watermelon, pineapple, cantaloupe, honeydew, strawberries). I didn't find them to be 'fresh'. Some of the strawberries tasted off and were mushy. One food item was labeled vegan. They were the crudités with vegan ranch. Dear goodness, it was the most awful tasting vegan ranch that landed in my mouth. I couldn't stomach it. \\n\\nOverall, I thought Bacchanal was pretty average for what they charge. Wow, I don't even remember who our waitress was. Oh well. I don't plan on coming back to this buffet in the near future. It's not worth the hype or price. So overrated!\",\n",
       " 'Great decor. That is all i can really say about this place. I would definitely prefer Wicked Spoon and Bellagio Buffet over Bacchanal.

It makes no sense to line up to get into the buffet and line up again to get your food.',\n",

       " \"I got to the buffet around 5:30 PM on a Saturday.  The line was ridiculously long and slow moving.  There is an express line that you can pay an extra 15 dollars for, which i decided to do.  Even in the express line, it still was an hour of waiting in line before I was seated.\\n\\nOn my way to my seat I walked passed a giant line of people with empty plates waiting for the meat station and the sea food station.   I had already been waiting for a while, and was pretty hungry so I decided to try other things first.\\n\\nI started off with their salad bar, they didn't have black olives or mushrooms, and they had these tall bottles for the dressing, the blue cheese seemed to be clogged up though which was a pain to deal with.   The lettuce was not cut small enough or at all in some cases, overall it was a pretty poor salad bar.\\n\\nI got some beef with broccolli from the asian station, and some lo mein, I also picked up a slice of pizza.  The beef with broccoli was the worst I've ever had(worse than when I used to make it in on a hotplate in college), the pizza was soggy and the lo main was mushy.   I found a section that was being blocked off by the enormous line, and got some clam chowder, which was watery and way to salty.\\n\\nGiving up on the other foods there I decided to wait in line for the meats.  It took 30 minutes before I got to the front, I got ribeye and a piece of brisket and returned to find my table completely cleared, I don't blame the servers for this, I had been away from my table for half an hour.  Although once in a buffet, half an hour is a ridiculous amount of time to spend in line.\\n\\nThe ribeye was well cooked and seasoned, the brisket was dry.   I then spent another 20 minutes waiting for seafood, the crab was decent but I have had way better.   The deserts that I tried at the desert station were really good, though the selection was somewhat small.\\n\\nOverall it was a pretty lousy experience, by the time I left the lines had significantly shortened, I might have just got unlucky with my timing, however the waits were totally unacceptable.  The whole buffet seemed poorly put together from the food, to the lines, to the general layout of the whole place.\\n\\nFor the price(45 dollars + 15 for the express pass), there are way better buffets in town.  Wicked spoon has been great every time I went, the buffet at the M was incredible.  The buffet at the bellagio and wynn are also good options.\",\n",

From sushi, to dimsum, and meats, everything was low quality, too greasy, too salty or just plain bad.  Long line of folks looking to get seafood, but judging by the smell of the whole area, I could tell it was not fresh, so skipped.  Those that give this place a good rating have either never been to  decent buffet or must just be country bumpkins.  I would honestly prefer golden corral.

I decided to go to Caesar's Palace, even if we were staying at the Venetian at 1 pm to secure a spot for dinner. \\n\\nWhen I got there, there was a winding line only for reservations. Basically, you put the number of people in your party on a computer screen and it will show you your estimated wait time AND a text message when your table is ready. I got to the screen around 1:30pm and the screen indicated that I will get a table by 7:00. It also instructed me to go back to the restaurant at the said time and that I would get a text message, too.\\n\\nWe stayed at Caesar's Palace even if we didn't really do anything there but go to Sephora. At 5pm, I decided to go back because this was our Christmas dinner and I didn't want to disappoint my mom and sisters. To my surprise, there was another long line, and this line was for those who got their call time. So I asked the hostess and she said that even if I checked in early, got a reservation, I still need to get in line. By now it's 6pm and she said that the line's wait time is around 4-5 hours. WHAT THE HECK!!! I told her then that I was there at 1pm and according to that stupid screen, I would get a table at 7pm. Another lady heard my complaint and she said she did the same thing. The hostess just told us that whether we got a ticket, a reservation, or a text message, we still need to wait in line, and the wait is 4-5 hours and that there is nothing she could do about it.\\n\\nSo my question: WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THAT RESERVATION SCREEN?!?! I could've just gotten in line at 1 pm, and by 5 hours, be able to sit my family down for dinner. \\n\\nWe wasted our time and it was Christmas Day. It was such a huge disappointment. I was so upset.

Out of all the food in the buffet, my favorites were the braised short rib cooked in root beer or regular beer, and the korean short ribs! The cheese pizza was ok. The seafood was ok. The chinese food was bland. I enjoyed the desserts...notably the gelato and the crepes. It was so not worth the $70 tab per person!

I then Learned that my addition of drinks was not added. Glad now since our attendant that was already tipped before we sat down was less than motivated to provide drinks, refills etc. I had to request several times that the dirty plates be removed and were now being stacked at the table.

My friends and I decided on Bacchanal due to the rave reviews and it was the worst mistake ever. \\n\\nDuring Labor Day weekend, the buffet was a horrifying $70 per person for dinner - yes, $70! Now, the steep price would not have mattered had the food been tasty or edible. My friend found a sizable PIECE OF METAL in one of their Italian meatballs. The metal resembled an industrial staple of some sort and luckily my friend spat it out before swallowing. We were absolutely horrified and disgusted - all appetites were lost at that point.\\n\\nPrior to the discovery, I sampled a number of dishes from their snow crab legs, crawfish, stone crabs, to their fried chicken, calamari, dimsum, and crab cakes. All failed to impress and were very disappointing. The snow crab legs were still frozen and small in size. The crawfish and shrimp was flavorful but way too salty. The dimsum lacked quality and seasoning. \\n\\nBacchanal boasts a large variety of dishes and desserts but the overall quality, cleanliness, and preparation is an absolute disaster. I give props to the manager for reacting quickly when we informed her of the metal staple, however, simply comping his meal and offering us free drinks was not enough. I mean, we had just started our meal and all appetites were lost following the discovery.\\n\\nFor a group of five, it was over $300 down the drain due to a poor buffet that could have landed my friend in the hospital.

There is no management system that says \"hey, too many people have requested an 8pm time, let\\'s close ticketing.\"  This results in hours of wasted time and probably lots of people throwing away money at the slots while they wait.

       " 'I was at Bacchanal the 26th of March 2016, so last week or so ago. It was my birthday trip to Vegas with hubby and I have heard all the most wonderful things about this place both on Yelp and on YouTube by numerous people that reviewed this place. I didn\\'t really care about the cost if it was really \"that\" outstanding. It was my first time in Vegas, my birthday and some much needed time shared with hubby away from family every day stress. I wanted to enjoy myself and Bacchanal was a place I planned on eating in while I was in Vegas. All the hype about it made me even more determined :)...... No matter the wait time or cost. \\n\\nSo 26th was a Sunday. Actually, an Easter Sunday at that. There was no lunch but only brunch and dinner and on top of that  Easter holiday priced brunch and dinner. Dinner was $69 and brunch $59 per person. Which again, I knew it was gonna be pricey. We ended up paying over $140 that day for the two of us. We waited for 2 hours and than we where put in a line which made us wait another 45 mins of so before we where seated. I figured it is a holiday and this place is normally busy .....but it\\'s worth it :).....so I\\'ll wait. \\n\\nSo we where finally seated. The server took our drink order, brought our drinks and disappeared .....never to return again. Out of two hours of allowed time in the buffet we where struggling to stay there more than an hour. Yes the choices where there but we where there mainly for seafood as we only eat seafood.......and there where 3-4 choices of it only and that includes the crab and prawn choices. There was no sushi, no hot and sour soup, no pad Thai......and not only that half of the stuff I saw on recent videos and review pictures was not there. Probably 1/2 desert options where not there, pizza was not there, dim sum was not there......a lot of the stuff I was looking forward to having was NOT THERE! \\n\\nThe bread was stone hard and cold. Nobody picked our plates up from our table at all....not once during entire time we where there. Our drinks where not refilled either. We ended up having potatoes and macaroni and cheese with our seafood \"choices\" which we clearly would not end up eating if there actually where some decent seafood \"choices\" LOL. I never thought cheesy macaroni and potatoes would cost me that much. \\n\\nWe had the crepes for desert and I was planing on pigging out on desert since I don\\'t do that normally and well.....this was suppose to be a place for that :). I went to find some macaroon and there where only two left on a huge empty tray .....the desert options where underwhelming ......I felt like I was in a completely different buffet than the one I was really looking forward to visiting. We also where never offered coffee/tea with our desert.......we ended up just walking out after all that hassle, waiting time, poor customer service and lack of food choices that we expected where gonna be there according to what we actually saw in all these reviews online......and all that for $140+ :))). Don\\'t get me wrong I don\\'t care about spending money on things that are worth it........but I felt what happened to us that day was a complete rip off. Either I was in a wrong buffet or I was stuck in  Twilight Zone going bonkers. I\\'m not hard to please but this was unfortunately just beyond bad :( ....  \\n\\nWe ended up ordering pizza later that night after we came back to our room. How insulting is that for a higher end buffet Bacchanal  claims to be? We where suppose to be sick to our stomachs  and ready to explode from all the food we devoured ....instead we where hungry :). By the way I weigh 165 pounds ......so I doesn\\'t take a huge amount to make me full.....\\n\\nBottom Line\\n- I WOULD NOT recommend this place to my friends and family nor do I have any desire to visit again.....next time I\\'m  in Vegas I\\'ll go somewhere else. If you got money to spend I\\'m sure you will find plenty of quality places around Vegas. If you are on a budget do yourself a huge favor and go out to eat somewhere more cheaper where they are more attentive and caring about their customers and you will more than likely still have a lot of that money leftover from the $140+ I have spent here .....and ended up hungry anyway....go see a show, go shopping, do anything else ......trust me you will be happier with your choice that throwing it away at this place\\n- Too much hype \\n- Not worth it one bit\\n- Just regular food\\n- Bad or non existent customer service',\n",

We got to the buffet at 6 pm to put our names in, which the hostess wouldn't allow.  We had to either wait in line for 30 minutes or come back and try our luck in an hour and boy what a difference that hour made.  We came back in an hour and were treated to a 2-hour wait in line.  No problem there.  We took the risk, but when we attempted to use the self-service machine to put our names in, the hostess promptly took the printout from us and ripped it up saying we had to wait in line.  This strategy is baffling for a casino, why would you want people to wait two hours in line when they could be on the floor gambling?\\n\\nWe finally got seated in the very back of the restaurant by the Asian food.  The seats that are against the wall are very cold as the AC is funneled along the back wall, so be sure you bring a sweater or wrap.  Our server was prompted and cleared out our plates as soon as we were done.  \\n\\nThe food was very disappointing.  The king crab legs and stone crab legs tasted like they were frozen and the texture was grainy with no flavor.  The mussles and oysters also had a mealy texture.  The only seafood that was decent had some kind of sauce to cover up the bland taste.  The dim sum was straight up inedible.  \\n\\nThe sushi, the meat and cheese section, and the dessert were the best sections in the buffet.  While these sections were the saving grace of the buffet, they did not make the price of admission worth the trip.  If you're looking for value, go to one of the fine dining restaurant than this disastrous buffet.\",\n",

You'll find diverse selection of food and the presentation on their desserts were quite good (like in Bellagio and Wynn).  That night I asked if they have any lamb and the gentleman told me they ran out. Food was good but nothing really stood out.\\n\\nThis year we came back again to give my in-laws (visiting from another county) a Vegas Buffet experience.

If you want to be in front of the line, you can pay an extra $20 for each person.  We asked the lady at the podium and she told us to check-in through a computer kiosk in front to give us the time to come back.  Estimated wait time is 134 minutes and our check-in time was at 5:18 PM.  According to our ticket, we needed to return and check back in at 7:27 PM.  I even left my cell number to get notified on our return time.  More than 2 hours of waiting time... so instead of keeping your money in your pocket, this is their subtle way of luring you in to playing on the casino floor and spending more money.  Then we came back around 7:00 PM and there was a huge line (BTW I DID NOT even get a text message  reminder for our return time).  We were told that we have to stand in line and wait for another 1 hour and 30 mins.  That is just ridiculous!  Of course we ended up eating at a different place.  I just hope that the line is not like this everyday. On a lighter note, there's this one lady who I think is a Diamond or a 7 Stars member who was going around the line of people and telling everyone that she can take anyone to the front of the line as long as they pay her cash LOL.

I went to the carver part of the buffet and saw a good selections of meats like prime rib, roast, duck, and rack of lamb. I decided to try the lamb and regretted that decision  immediately.

Lastly, we have been here before so this is a reminder to myself and others to be very careful and trust your instincts when looking at the selections. \\n\\nEven before getting sick the entire party agreed that the food quality, selection, choices, and service has gone down. The meat selections while visually appetizing were under seasoned and under temperature, the Asian food was awful with many items being lukewarm, the dessert selections were just fine but lacking oomph...\\n\\nEat at your own risk. Sure this can happen anywhere but a place like this is responsible for ensuring each item as well as staff are abiding by proper food preparation and serving guidelines. We have tried contacting management but were unable to get a hold of anyone over the weekend.',\n",

I will not be coming back, which is a shame because the food selection and flavors were wonderful. None of the dishes were cleared off the table and everything was overflowing, and they didn't get us any refills or anything. The servers won't make eye contact so they don't have to serve you. I'm leaving $40 tip, but don't mistake that for good service. It was absolutely terrible. Do not come here if you want to be treated decently.\",\n",

Sashimi was not that fresh, Todai is better reasonable price & no lines. Oysters were sweet but the shuckers were slackers they were too SLOW on opening up the well liked oysters and they were shucking the tiny oysters not good, crab legs forget about it lacking in taste too low of a quality.

Ended up coming back at around 9pm, STARVING, only to be told that there's a long line and there is no guarantee we will even have any time to eat by the time we get to the front of the line.

       " 'Another highly rated buffet, another letdown. \\n\\nThe wait to get in this place is obnoxious. We tried to go last year and the wait was 2-3 hours long. This year, we called ahead of time and were quoted a 45 minute wait. Upon arrival, we put our name into the system and then had to wait 15 minutes for the \"okay\" to be added to the list. We then waited about 45 minutes to be \"accepted\" into the line to pay. Once we entered the pay line, it was another 45 minute wait. So, I\\'m not sure how we were quoted a 45 minute wait time... yeah, maybe 45 minutes for each \"line\". Overall, about 2 hours of waiting. Not worth it. \\n\\nFor $54, I am expecting a grand buffet. This was nowhere near that. The prime rib was wayyy undercooked, to the point that there were pools of blood on my plate. The lamb chops were wayyyy overcooked. The butter station was constantly empty and they give you little ghetto plastic cups for your butter. I went on a wild goose chase to find horseradish for my prime rib. ONE person running the meat station, as opposed to Bellagio Buffet where they have a separate person for each cut of meat. The shrimp had a really stinky smell and I kept getting little slivers of shell in my crab meat. Just no. \\n\\nHonestly, the highlight of my meal was the gelato station. Strawberry Balsamic, Salted Vanilla, and Nutella Coffee gelato were pretty darn good. It\\'s sad that this was the best part of my $54 meal. I\\'ll be going back to Bellagio Buffet next time.',\n",

Based on the shockingly chaotic system now, you\\'ve been warned: avoid this buffet (at least during the holidays). PR disaster here with many visibly frustrated people in the crowds around the buffet, but what does the buffet care? They will ring in the money anyway, despite lots of unhappy people and negative word going around. That\\'s an unfortunate vibe that came off to me.\\n\\nIt\\'s man versus machine. When you walk up to the buffet, there are now rows of ticket machines. No notable sign explaining what these machines are (they\\'re like the Fast Pass machines at Disneyland). You\\'re expected to wade through the crowds and insert your information into the machine and the screen tells you when exactly to come back -- do not expect anything less than three hours! Many of these machines don\\'t even work, so even though you\\'re supposed to get a ticket, they end up telling you that you \"don\\'t need a ticket.\" The system is *supposed to* help spread out/manage the crowds, and it\\'s *supposed to* be your \"ticket\" in at the allotted time.\\n\\nBut when we come back at the time we were scheduled for and found a worker, he told us that they\\'re not letting any more people in to the buffet even with a \"ticket\" and that the wait will be another 3 hours (so, a total of 6 hours). There are just \"too many people we didn\\'t expect.\" Wait. So what was the point of scheduling and giving out tickets and waiting the three hours? And why not alert people of the extreme wait times BEFORE they wait the three hours only to be then turned away. After all, the machine took contact information. Why bother with a flawed system that ultimately is much more confusing and chaotic than simply lining up when you get there? Unlike Disneyland\\'s FastPass, this ticket system is a disorganized mess.\\n\\nFinally, if you try to clarify with any of the few workers here, they respond with curt, smug replies. Maybe it\\'s the holiday stress on everyone, but their demeanor and really lack of service or care is unfortunate and not helping the situation.

Our ticket said: APPROXIMATE CHECK IN TIME WILL BE 11:05AM and that we'd get a text a few minutes before... We never got a text and when we went up to the line, they made us stand in line ANYWAY. WHAT IS THE POINT OF THEM HAVING THAT DUMB MACHINE THERE IF WE HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE?? THEY SHOULD HAVE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS saying EVEN IF YOU HAVE THIS TICKET YOU STILL HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE.  Our group was trying to be understanding and saying well it IS Christmas and they're extremely busy. THAT wasn't the part that pissed us off. We waited over 2 hours IN LINE (NOT counting the 1 hour we spent near by waiting for our TEXT that we never GOT) and when we got to the front of the line, we stopped moving up for over 30 minutes because they started letting this OTHER line ahead of us. I guess these people were the 7-star guests, or guests that paid extra. WHY WOULDNT YOU JUST DO A SEPARATE ENTRANCE FOR THESE PEOPLE INSTEAD OF SHOVING THEM IN FRONT OF US WHILE WE STAND THERE WATCHING THIS HAPPEN?? IS THAT YOUR WAY OF ADVERTISING - IF YOU WANT TO GET IN, THEN PAY EXTRA PER PERSON? ALSO there were some guests that started complaining and screaming so THEY were ALSO shoved in front of us. SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT... PATIENT guests like US get punished and stuck in line, while SCREAMING guests get put in front of the line... WHAT AN AWESOME management system  you got there. We got so fed up and left to eat at Spago - which turned out to be better.  EVEN THOUGH this WAS my favorite buffet EVER, I probably won't go back since they have the worst management/customer service ever.

       " \"Came here for lunch, made it here at around 11:30 and there was a small line but nothing too bad. Two stars because the selection was not what I expected for a $54.99 buffet. No oysters, no sashimi, sushi selection was bad. Shrimp wasn't good quality, it was pretty mushy. Crab legs were fine and the meat section was fine too. Most of the food was subpar, and trust me, I expect any buffet to have subpar food. But some of the food was subpar to some of the other buffets I've had. If price wasn't a factor, I'd give this buffet 3.5 stars. 2 stars considering it was $55 a person and at this level of quality.\",\n",
       " \"This is the most overhyped restaurant I've ever been to. The line is way too long for how mediocre this food is. They try to be upscale with their selection and set up, but the quality of food does not live up to it. I was very disappointed with mostly everything. \\n\\nThe American Wagyu was bland and it took too long to get a cut, so by the time I got to my table, my vegetables were cold. However, I wouldn't have eaten them anyway because they had a rancid fish taste to them. If you do want sides, pick them up after you get whatever meat you choose. The tomato bisque was pretty rancid tasting, too. It actually tasted how dirty gym bags smell. The only beef that was well seasoned was the tri tip beef, but my cut was way over done. \\n\\nEven the desserts were terrible. I got a little sample of some of them, and tried a bite of them. The cheesecake tasted like it was beyond it's expiration date, the cookie was bitter, and various other desserts tasted off. I have no idea what was going on with the desserts, but I would not want to eat any of them again. None of them were worth a second bite. No one in my group finished any of the dessert except the fresh apple. \\n\\nThe best part of my meal was the coffee, the cooked Salmon, and the Creme brûlée. They weren't delicious, but they were the best of what I tasted. I did not eat all of anything I put on my plate. More than half the food I tried didn't get a second bite. I was expecting a delicious meal for how popular this place is, but I left feeling like my time, and my money was wasted. I could have eaten something quick on the strip and felt more satisfied. \\n\\nMy husband never complains about food and he always finishes what's on his place, but even he couldn't eat their food. It has got to be extremely terrible for him to turn away food. I've never seen him so dissatisfied with a meal and I've burned his dinner more than once. \\n\\nIf you are very hungry, you enjoy standing in line after line, and you want to eat a pile of mediocre food, this is for you. If you like to enjoy your food and want something of quality, not quantity, this is not the place for you. I read that this is the best buffet in Vegas.

The receipt says that you have two hours to eat.  We got in around 10 and they started taking food away at 10:45.  And the food that was out there was not all that great.  They had crab legs that were still frozen out there.  This was the one thing my mom wanted to do on our visit and it was a humongous disappointment.  They weren't ready for the crowd and we felt cheated and misled because we should have been able to eat until midnight if you let us in at 10 even if you say your hours are until 11.  If you aren't going to allow that, then you need to convey that to the consumer.  I have to wonder what happened to the groups even behind us.  Will never return here again!  Awful!\",\n",

I actually tried to discreetly decline the rose they were offering for the photo to avoid having happen what I knew was going to happen but was asked repeatedly until I selected a red or pink one to have the photo taken.

I was STILL unable to actually get it after speaking to three different people, each of which said they needed to \"go to the back\" only to take several minutes to disappear. At least 20 minutes AFTER the meal was wasted with still zero result. \\n\\nI don\\'t care how high the quality of your food is. When you are charging a premium for a product such this, the experience becomes the product and there just isn\\'t any room for ruining that experience with inattentiveness, especially for a prouct I\\'m not asking for in the first place. I\\'m sure there are more than enough people willing to wait to prevent any meaningful action on this statement so the rest of you who want to go will have one less person to wait behind.

I spoke to Amber, and after trying to explain the whole situation to her and how long we had been waiting, she responds with a \"there she is\", as she points to a server. Not only did it seem that she was uncaring and unapologetic about the whole issue, but after hearing the concern in my voice she refuses to apologize or make me feel any more comfortable about the situation. It was very unprofessional, and rubbed me the wrong way. A simple, \"I\\'m sorry\" would have sufficed. \\n\\nOn a more positive note, Maria was our server and was outstanding.

Then when we got to the front of the line, the \"joke-stess\" called forward a party behind us.  She told us we would only have to wait 2 more minutes, which turned out to be 30 more minutes.  We had to complain to the manager in order to be seated.  And finally, when the rope line was opened for us to go sit down, the hostess miscounted the number of people in our group by a large amount.  Whether for lack of attention or inability to count, they obviously were not running the place competently.  \\n\\nSimilar to what another reviewer stated, we got to our table to find that there were plenty of open tables that would have accommodated our group.  We also saw that they seated a party with less people than ours at a table meant for 8.  \\n\\nO_O\\n\\nOk enough of the introductions--let\\'s get on to the food.\\n\\nMany people seemed crazy about the crab legs.  I guess many people go to buffets only for the crab.  I go for everything.  \\n\\nTypically, buffet food is a little stale because it kinda sits there for a while.  For the price this place charges, you would think their food would be a little different......  not the case.    this food is your usual crusty-edged garbage that results from being over exposed to warming lamps.  \\n\\nThe variety of options was also not impressive.  Even if there were items that are not normally at a traditional buffet, people didn\\'t choose them.  They just remained in the heating lamps drying out.

What was worse, some random customers also got in on the fun by laughing at me with him about how I wasn't allowed to get food till I got in line when I was standing there for over 10 mins next to no one! He even went out of his way to ignore me and pretending like he couldn't see me even though I was directly in front of him. I was so embarrassed and felt so stupid that I started crying which made me feel like a fatty. I told a manager and all they could do was offer me food to fix the situation.

The line was loooooong but that was expected.  Once seated at the table, my husband and daughter decided to tackle the ONCE AGAIN LONG LINE at the meat carving station while I decided to tackle the shorter line at the seafood station since I was already starving at this point.   While chowing down on the SUPER SALTY crab legs, I wondered where my husband and daughter were since they still haven't sat down to eat with me.   It nearly took them 30 minutes standing in line at the meat carving station!!  By the time they joined me at the table, I was ready to sample the rest of the food.  I then walked all the way towards the back to the Asian section (by the way the flow of the buffet just doesn't make sense!) to maybe try some sushi or sashimi.   There weren't that many good sushi selections either that's all they has or they just don't replenish fast enough.   I decided to skip the Asian section and walk my way towards the front.  I wanted some cured meats and cheese, but yet again the Parmesan cheese was a whole big block -no shavings or pieces one would have easy access to.  I was looking around for a knife maybe I thought one had to shave the cheese off himself, but no tool was around!  I was really getting frustrated at this point, but I still decided not to give up and try the meat carving station.  I had wishful thinking that the line was going to be shorter this time than when my husband and daughter were here.  Needless to say, the line was not any faster but at this point this was my last resort the last station i want to try since they have Prime Rib - my favorite, so I patiently wait for my turn.  Finally I get Prime Rib with Au Jus on my plate and  FINALLY join my family at the table, to only find out they are ALREADY DONE EATING!  I don't blame them since I was gone for almost 30 minutes!!!   To top it all off, the Au Jus that soaked my Prime Rib was sooo salty that I could only eat 3 bites out of that meat!  I was enraged at this point that I didn't even care to try their desserts!    Not being able to eat at the same time with my family because of the ridiculously long lines at the food stations and to be fed salty dishes is just absurd!   All in all, Bachannal Buffet DOES NOT live up to the hype!   The food is so much better elsewhere!  You're better off going to The Wicked Spoon at The Cosmo or The Studio B Buffet at The M Resort.\",\n",

Long line of people waiting to get the oysters, which holds up the seafood line. Seems like they are understaffed. Not good. Then for the meat, had to wait in another long line. The meat is sitting under a heated lamp, so for prime rib, it was medium well to well done. I like it medium rare! Sucks.\\n\\nSushi was ok, not much variety. Desserts were yummy though.

When our server came to ask for our drink order, he was confused when we said there was no fourth person at our table. He kept saying, \"It says 4!\" Us: \"We\\'re just 3...\" And he made us repeat our drink orders. He snatched the seating book and walked away saying he needed to check on something. Minutes later, one of the hostesses is at our table demanding our receipts. We take them out, and we ask what\\'s wrong. She couldn\\'t answer us, but said that we had done nothing wrong. Yet, when we asked what we needed to do or what she needed from us, she wouldn\\'t leave. She finally stomps away when we firmly said, \"Well, if we did nothing wrong and we\\'ve shown you our receipts, like you\\'ve asked, then... what do you still need?\" (Not so subtle hint.) She leaves. Then a SECOND hostess comes rushing to our table and asks to see our receipts. Again. This time, we finally get an answer on what\\'s wrong, and she explains the mistake that I mentioned in the first part of this paragraph. She says she just needs our receipt numbers and names so she can track down the table and server that had our receipts so the right servers could get the right pre-paid tips. \\n\\nWe never hear back from the hostesses again, so we never found out if they had straightened out the issue. Our server seemed to be backed up by too-attentive server from the table next to us, so he was actually the person to notice that our drinks were low.

The food overall was ok, but if you are going to charge the highest price for a buffet on the strip, I think the food should be much better than just ok.',\n",

       " 'Mediocre but totally overcooked meat. The only thing I liked were the pork ribs. It felt like a waste of money and time. We had to wait 2 hours, which was not a problem thanks to the automatic check-in. We wanted to do the \"Buffet of Buffets,\" but found out just as we were about to pay that we actually had to purchase the pass for $59.99, instead of $54.99 for dinner plus $35 for the \"Buffet of Buffets\" upgrade, as advertised on their sign where the check-in kiosks were. The \"Buffet of Buffets\" pass actually does not include Bacchanal, so if you wanted to purchase the pass, you\\'d have to spend another $25 for brunch and $35 for dinner. This is totally dishonest pricing. We calculated it while we were in line and came to the conclusion that this \"deal\" doesn\\'t make sense at all. We finally realized that it is only a deal if you plan on going to their sister buffets. We tried talking to a manager who didn\\'t understand the issue and offered no real explanation why the sign in the front was misleading.\\n\\nTL;DR: Two stars for the large variety of food, but it is not worth it if you like meat. \"Buffet of Buffets\" pass cannot be used here.\\n\\nEdit, to respond to the reply. Yes, I agree that the pamphlet is clear about the pass being $59.99. The point is that their pricing signage board is very misleading and confusing. We were thinking we had to pay $54.99 + $35 to upgrade to the Buffet of Buffets pass, so to find out after waiting 2 hours that we actually had to purchase a pass for $59.99 and then spend more money on additional fees in order to even use it at Bacchanal is very disappointing and frustrating. These pamphlets are kept behind the cash register and not made readily available to customers. The point is not about the cost of the buffet, but that a business should make the pricing completely transparent so that it would not be a surprise to customers. And the manager on duty was completely useless after we voiced our complaint. Aside from this whole pricing debacle, the food just wasn\\'t that good. Definitely quantity over quality here.',\n",

When I checked on him, his pants were totally wet. There was a water leak from the ceiling right above him, and I took a look at his chair and it was all wet. I had called one gentlemen in vest working there who was not our waiter, and explained the situation. He never said sorry to us, nothing. What he did was call another waiter. She just moved the table to the side. That's it. None of them said anything to us for this inconvenience. After that I had to take off his pant because they were all wet. After that we couldn't stay more than 30 mins in the restaurant because my son started to feel itchy and irritated. This whole experience for tonight ruined our love for this buffet.

The overall experience should be 3 stars, but I am taking 1 star off because of the price we paid. With the price we paid, we expected a higher quality buffet. We visited this place for brunch during the July 4th week, so the price for lunch is $59.99 + tax + tips (close to $80 per person). During the holiday, the breakfast costs $39.99, brunch costs $59.99, and Dinner costs $69.99. First of all, one of the cashiers \"Grace\" is rude, and there is miscommunication between the cashiers, hosts and kitchen staffs. We arrived around 10am, and we were welcome to look at the food selections before we decided to eat there. One of hosts said there will be more items added to the buffets during lunch hours starting at 11 am. If we go in before 10:30 am, the price would be $39.99. So we decided to get in around 10:25 am to lock in the $39.99 price, the cashier Grace was saying the price should be $59.99 and the price $39.99 ends at 9:30 am, not 10:30 am. When we told her the host told us a different timeline earlier, then Grace responded us with an attitude like we tried to cheat to get in at a lower price. I totally understand if the host provided us the wrong information, but Grace didn\\'t have to explain it in such a rude way. Anyway, we paid $59.99 per person to get in and the host apologized to us regarding the wrong information she provided earlier. Then it comes to advertisement issue... Many items from the brunch holiday menu are missing from the actual buffet selections. If you are going to charge more for the holiday buffet, please commit to what you advertised on the menu. When we complained the missing food items from the menu, they said the menu was wrong. So they removed the menu instead of adding the missing menu items to the buffet for their customer. Since we looked around during breakfast time (for price at $39.99), we know what they have for breakfast. At 11:00 am, nothing much was added to the lunch buffet (at $59.99). So basically, they are charging more with no additional items added to the buffet. Last but not least, the food is just average comparing to a regular buffet, but it is below average comparing to a hotel/ good restaurant. I am very disappointed with their desserts. I agree they have good selections of different cuisines, but nothing is performing at the best. I ordered a soufflé from the dessert counter, and it is totally taste nothing like soufflé. If you don\\'t tell me it is a soufflé, I would not able to tell. It tastes like a chewy cake or bread? It is a failure for sure.

The cranky old lady hostess still made us wait at least 15 minutes to get seated. \\n\\nStrike no 1. \\n\\nCranky old lady no 2 was our server, who definitely had an attitude problem and ignored us and took forever with drinks. \\n\\nStrike no 2. \\n\\nThe final strike was the food. Maybe you have never had a great buffet. This is not a great buffet. I would gladly pay 130 bucks (two people) for a great buffet. This is more like a 60 dollar buffet maybe 80. For two ppl. The hot food was nothing better than you would get at a much cheaper buffet. The pork, chicken, beef dishes were all cold.  I can't even think of one dish that was memorable. There was nothing spectacular. The shrimp was okay, crab claws were nothing great. The desserts were absolutely atrocious.  I can get better gelato and cookies and bread pudding at Safeway. \\n\\nDon't make the same mistake we did. If this is the best buffet in Vegas there is no great buffet in Vegas.\",\n",
       " 'Very disappointing. Figured Caesars was associated with Nobu Hotel which has a distinctive Asian influence and would thus have amazing sushi. Nope. Not even close. The rice was cold from the refrigerator with small fish again w a refrigerated appearance and flavor. The cold crab was watery. The seafood rice dish was gummy.  The mashed potatoes were bland. The sea bass was mealy.And the oyster was the most disgusted thing. I actually spat it out due to the fear I would get sick. On the plus side:1) I got a discount of $80. Dinner for four would have been about $240 but we got it for about $160. 2) The hot crab was great! 3) the beef ribs yummy. Sooo stay away from much of the seafood and rice dishes. Also get a discount so you only feel ripped off by $100 vs $180.',\n",

We decided to head up to the advertised \"#1 Buffet in Las Vegas\". We knew there would be a long wait because of Thanksgiving, so we arrived early.....like EVERYONE else and started to wait. We were told that the wait would be 4 hours from where we were at 3:00pm, so 7:00pm dinner sounds fine to us. We switched off every hour or so to make the wait easier. Long story short, it took FIVE hours to get to the spot to pay, which gets us to another line where it took another 45 minutes to be seated.\\n\\nThere was also a priority line and a VIP line where you either pay $20 extra per person to get in quicker or you had some VIP status at Caesar\\'s due to stays or lots of gambling. either way, it made the 99% of us really frustrated because they would seat 4-5 tables of them first, then seat the \"normal\" people, then 4-5, then ONE, etc. This not only makes it unfair in a way, but it made the line and wait even longer.\\n\\nOnly good thing was that Caesar\\'s Palace had someone past out water as we waited in line. With all the money they have and make they should\\'ve done more for the people. Sure it was our decision on wait in line like idiots, but you were way off in your estimated time because you decided to cater to the 1% and screw the 99%. I wasn\\'t going to wait four hours and just leave. So what;\\'s done is done.\\n\\nThis place is a \"Jack of all trades, master of none\". I\\'m going to assume that their \"#1\" status was gained by the variety of food, Not gonna lie but there was a LOT to choose from. Problem is EVERYTHING was dried up by the food lamps. And the flavor didn\\'t really make me think \"best buffet\" dry or not. There was NOTHING that made me want to come back to this restaurant. In terms of authenticity in flavor, since I\\'m Chinese I\\'ll tell you that the Chinese food is not up to par. It was close and edible. but definitely lacking the authentic flavor.....kinda like asking for a Coke and getting a Pepsi instead, there is a difference.\\n\\nWill I revisit. YES, I always re-try the places I don\\'t like for dumb reasons like this whole waiting issue. But until then I\\'ll have to stick with a 2 star review.

But many people think it is worth it to see the hype, so it does not hurt to try it if you wanna waste a day out of your short Vegas trip in line. I won\\'t be back. We were there for New Year\\'s Eve, price was about $93 per person for dinner. Definitely not worth the price since I went there again just to see the difference at about $69 per person for dinner. Not much difference and the food is not worth the price point even at the lower $69. The wait was horrible. Las Vegas is a place you should feel luxury so don\\'t punish yourself and your loved ones by waiting so long in line. \\n\\nWorst part about this experience is actually the service, not that I expect much from Caesar\\'s Palace, since it is no match in quality to Wynn or MGM corporation hotels. We waited for our orange juice for 15 to 20 minutes asking two different servers. Finally I called over another server and asked politely:\" how long does it take to get an orange juice usually?\" He replied with disrespect and impatience and said \"who did you ask\" (like I would know your employees), \"he should be on his way.\" First off, how would you know that he is on his way without checking. They definitely don\\'t deserve tips. So don\\'t pay the tips at the beginning with your credit card when you pay for the buffet. It is a sign that management is lacking here. Food is very mediocre and does not match the price point. Hope this review helps.',\n",

For me, the highlights were the lamb, salmon, and salads. Aside from that though, the crab was salty, the crawfish quality was bad, and the dessert was bleh. I'm am overall disappointed and unimpressed by this buffet. You can get better quality and more reasonable prices at a Reno buffet.\",\n",
       " 'I went to the Bacchanal Buffet this past Friday night. It was NG. I really do not think it is worth what I paid. My husband and I have heard how great the buffet was. We were excited about going to try it because they claim they are the best buffet in Vegas. We paid $116.73 for two. Alcohol is an additional charge. We had two glasses of white wine for $18 including the tip. The total bill was about $135 for two people.\\nI saw a dirty, disgusting spot on the chair when the host seated me. They switched the chair for me when I pointed out the problem to them. However, they simply swapped it with a chair from another table.\\n\\nThe food selection was low. There was an Asian section. Chinese dishes were typical cheap American Chinese food. Crab was soaked in a heavy soy sauce starch gravy.  There was a couple of dim sum. The fillings of those dishes were not fresh, skin was on the thick side. On top of that, they really did not taste that good. Japanese food included a few typical rolls and they were mediocre at best. My husband tried the pizza, he said it was all right. If you like cheese, you will not find any good ones here. The selection was poor, and they were old and cheap. I tried yellow cheddar, white cheddar and Brie, and that was pretty much all they had. \\n\\nItalian assuage was OK. Sea bass was terrible. They were cold and old. Crab legs has nothing special to mention. Dessert was just OK. I have had better ones somewhere else. I am disappointed about them. They said the buffet included soft drinks, but that does not include latte. I chose the coffee at the end of the meal. It was not that good at all. I believe it was cheap coffee. \\n\\nOverall, I believe they have cut corners. The ingredients are on the cheap side. Believe me, there is no such thing as dishes made to order on the spot. It turned out to be false talk that they have been putting in people\\'s ear. I truly regret going there. I ended up eating some cheap (at a high price) food that I normally do not eat. My definition for this buffet is \"cheap\" ingredients + American cooking techniques + fancy name ( I am looking at you BACCHANAL) = TV dinner in Caesars Palace . I HATE IT. If you do not believe me, please go find out by yourself. \\nif you need any advice where to eat in Vegas (and it probably won\\'t cost as much as Bacchanal Buffet) you should try \"Joe\\'s Stone Crab\" at Cesars, \"Social House\" for Japanese food in Crystal and \"Sushi Roku\" in Caesars (with a great strip view) is good to me, along with Mon Ami Gabi in Paris.',\n",

There was an hour wait to get to the line that did not look like it was moving, so we opted in to paying $25 each (on top of the $70 ea to \"skip the line\".  We went to the VIP area and stood in line for about 15min only to be told we were in the wrong line.  They insisted there was a sign that instructed where the express VIP should stand, and there wasn\\'t.  Indeed, I brought them the sign they insisted said \"express\" and pointed out that it said \"diamond\" and that two of the signs said diamond.   I was foolish to expect an apology, or professional correction, or something.  So - we went to the back of the line (after four other parties got in front) and meanwhile we saw the same thing happen to another couple in another unmarked line!  We let them go first bc they had been standing there being ignored longer than any of us. \\n\\nOk, it\\'s NY day and they were busy and have incompetent ppl taking money.

Woot.  \\n\\nWe love food.  But, With the prices paid, I expected more.  We could have gone pretty much anywhere else and gotten the same quality.  You\\'re paying for presentation here.  They had all kinds of things, great variety, but all of it mediocre. And much of it room temp or cold. Some strangely cooked. (A roasted gourd salad that was too raw to cut, mushy egg rolls).

Lobster and so on.. And when I found the numbers of yelp reviews, this seemed the most popular in vegas.

All they had was just lobsters boiled in hot water. And they smell/ taste weird when you really eat it in your mouth. Also there\\'s long line again in this menu. But they give you only one piece per person so if you want more, you have to repeat waiting on lines for more lobsters..Well, no worth to repeat the waiting you will find out though... \\nI almost came this buffet for this lobster but such a big disappointment. \\n(PS. after writing this review, i found another yelper uploaded photo of AYCE whole lobster that I haven\\'t seen or had at all. There were only boiled tails on 12/25 around 2pm.) \\n\\nOyster and the Crab: looking like trash at the serving plates. And they taste no fresh at all like the look of them.  \\n\\nSushi collection: so limited kinds and very small amount on the serving plates. Only salmon and yellow tail sushi are the better menus in this section.   \\n\\nMeat: tri tip, wagyu beef,etc: no flavor, no taste. Sausages are better options. \\n\\nFried Chicken: one of the best menus in this buffet. Probably this and the mushroom soup are the only 2 menus I can say great. \\n\\nLobster bisque: I didn\\'t know lobster bisque could be bad until today. \\n\\nCioppino: better than lobster bisque but I\\'m from bay area so it doesn\\'t taste original to me. \\n\\nMushroom soup: the best menu in this buffet. so funny that something really delicious from this $$$ buffet was mushroom soup only. \\n\\nDessert: not many options on fruits. Cantaloupe, honeydew, pineapple that\\'s all. And other sweet things..no delicious at all on all pies and cakes and whatevers.\\n\\nPizza and other italians: it\\'s ok probably similar quality in Souplantation but less selections.\\nChinese section: noodles: all soggy and been there so long. not tasty, dimsum: Do not make your belly fat with something not delicious at all\\nMexican section: I lost my appetite so i didn\\'t try the taco bar that they made by your order. It could be good.. \\nOther small sampler dishes : probably better at costco samples \\nIf you come here for lobster, I recommend you to get a couple of packs (usually 6 tails in one pack) in costco and put them in the oven and crave.

However, we only had one hour to eat and food was take away in 45 minutes because we only got seated at 10pm and they close at 11pm.  That was a horrible experience!

Don't get me wrong, this buffet is extremely busy and popular, and just because of that, even when the quality is poor, they will always have the demend. I waited 5 minutes in the Vip line, I can't picture myself to  wait more than 15 minutes in the regular line for this. Its just not worth it.

The line was long which is some what understandable due to it being Christmas weekend. What was really making a lot of people upset in line was that we all have time stamped tickets and people were in line even though their time was not up to go in line. Our ticket said 6:25pm, which is the time we went to the line and then being surprised there was another wait of over an hour, the issue is that people ahead of us had times at 6:45 and even 7 and 8!

There is no point to this ticket system, I would of waited the 3-4 hours in an actual line, where we can keep our appropriate spot and keep things in order.

I spoke with the restaurant manager Raz P. to explain that we were told $40 on the phone. Without an ounce of compassion, he told us to come back July 5th for that price. I had enough money to cover the difference that my daughter had saved up to buy breakfast. But we felt $60 was way too much for us to pay for breakfast.

       " 'Worst service ever, estevan, took forever to come to our table, we had to look for him everywhere, seriously our empty plates were sitting on our table for 45 minutes, we had to ask someone else to pick them up, we paid for the unlimited alcohol drinks which is $18 per person, and he only showed up once in two hours, so guess what? I only had 2 beers because our server only showed up one time after bringing the first beer. I am so dissapointed, food is good but service is super bad, and when you get a bad service, it is more likely that you never go back to a place. I am a server and I know this is not a fine dining place but honestly, I was expecting much more from this buffet at the Caesars Palace Hotel in Las Vegas.',\n",
       " \"My husband and I were very excited to be back in Vegas and get back to Bacchanal. Well, things sure have changed since 2013! We were VERY disappointed!! The seafood was sub par. Stone crabs from Mexico instead of the wonderful Florida kind. Tiny snow crab legs, tiny oysters filled with bits of shell. Little clams with gritty sand in them. The whole roasted pig sat there and was dry. Much of the food just sat there under the lamps. The charcuterie was dried out and inedible. The Asian food was just sitting there luke warm at best. The blue crab stir fry was cold and dry. The sushi was warm... (a very bad thing) and it's rice cold and hard.\\xa0 The sushi rolls...not even a decent tuna or salmon roll...just that mixed fake crab salad roll. The poke also warm raw fish. Surprising people aren't getting food poisoning. The made to order soups... Singapore laksa was soooo greasy and smelled of fish in the wrong way. The ramen broth was ok but the noodles not cooked enough. The entire mexican food area just sat there with knowone taking any of it. They must see how certain areas are not moving; why on earth do they keep serving it!! Strange desserts. I'm sorry but this experience was liken to the disgusting Golden Corral buffet but with a huge price tag. They have some nerve charging what they do. Much of it left on everyones plate going into the garbage. There's nothing lux about this place! Frankly, I want my money back. Do yourself a favor and keep your money in your pocket. I'm serious. I travel all over the world and have tried many a cuisine... this is bottom of the barrel at best.\",\n",
       " \"I am a regular to Vegas, 2-3x times a year, and have been Diamond with Caesars for years.  Can't say I was very impressed, and most of that hinged on one thing.  Not the food, not the drink service, but the staffing in terms of keeping the tables clear of dirty dishes.\\n\\n4 of us went on a busy Saturday night, naturally it was at capacity as would be expected. Got seated and every empty table we saw was stacked with dirty dishes.  At a $50+ price point for dinner, hire a few more bus staff.  We went up for a second round, came back to the table 10-15 minutes later (yes, buffet is that extensive) all the dirty dishes glasses, etc were right where we left them.  And no, they didn't have a good quantity of food or drink in them, they were clearly done with.  Again, at the price point of $50+  per head, in surroundings that reportedly made it the most expensive buffet to build in Vegas, is the expense to clear tables really that much?  Even the tables that had been vacant for 20 minutes were untouched.  That's a lot of lost revenue by not being able to seat new customers. (Did I mention it was $50+ apiece)?\\n\\nTo top it off, on the way out I saw a manager near the exit, and mentioned that while the food was good, they need more staff to keep the dining room clear.  His response, that there are plenty of staff, they're just union and lazy.  There's a sentiment for you. I wanted to reply back that perhaps it was more due to poor leadership, management, hiring practices, or just cutting corners on staffing...but restrained myself.  \\n\\nBottom line.  Go next door to Mirage.  Maybe the food isn't quite as high end (but still very good), but still very good, well staffed, clean, well organized, wine and beer included, and save yourself some money.\",\n",
       " 'My experience actually happened around May 2015. Horrible attitude from the hostess. Basically, she ruined our family  dinner. She started to give us attitude  from the beginning.... long story short, we were a party of 8, but we decided to divide our group into two, and the hostess, purposely, sat one to the north pole and the other to the south pole even though  there were plenty  of tables right beside of each end. Called the manager  and he apologized but nothing much happened. Hope that hostess (white-hispanic  looking, chubby one w black long hair) gets fired. Do u think I am harsh? Nah...ppl w those attitude should  not be in the service  industry. Will not come back to this buffet  ever.',\n",
       " 'Food was overcooked, dry and salty. I was not impressed with the variety of food. I would not recommend this place because of the cost and quality of food',\n",
       " 'Overrated! After hearing things like \"best buffet in Vegas,\" \"must try,\" and \"amazing\" I had really high hopes for this buffet. At $60.00 a person it is a disappointment and waste of money. We tried each station and walked away unsatisfied. For a girl who can always find a few desserts to enjoy...I didn\\'t grab a single thing from the dessert station. Nothing looked appetizing. Sorely disappointed!',\n",
       " \"$53 for Sunday dinner. I've been wanting to eat here and my family finally took me on my birthday. The only thing worth talking about was the lamb. It was amazing. Everything else was mediocre. No ones been posting recent photos of the food and I think after it was dubbed the #1 buffet in Vegas, it let go of itself. What happened to the French macaroons, crazy gelato flavors, fresh honey from the honeycomb and all the other goodies ppl have been boasting about? I feel hella cheated. As for the the chefs, I feel bad for them. Some ppl just don't have common sense. Idk how many times the chefs have told ppl to stop eating on the line and to take the plates with the food they literally transferred onto their personal plate via their hands. Smh* ppl!\",\n",
       " 'As platinum card holders, Bacchanal Buffet was our #1 spot to eat in Vegas every time we were in town. We usually have a great time at Bacchanal, but when we went there on July 16 we were disappointed. The service was terrible, the food staff in the seafood section was careless and unfriendly, the food quality was not up to par, the seafood was frozen, the meat in the sliders were dry, and you had to crack the heated crab yourself. I will not be returning to Bacchanals anytime soon.',\n",
       " 'The lady in front lied to us about the wait time. 1 hour wait? My ass. It was a 3 hour wait. Not worth it at all. Went to dinner somewhere else.',\n",
       " 'First of all. After putting our information into their computer system for a party of 4 we were told to come back 2 and half hours to pay for the meal and get back on line to be seated, upon returning. It took more than one hour to pay for the meal and another 45 min to be seated, for 75 a person, food is acceptable with many variety of dishes, but to my view it is over rated and to wait so long to be seated it is just not what I expected',\n",
       " 'Way over price over crowded and no pasta on the buffet. Carnival in Rio is better and cheaper I think.',\n",
       " 'wait for 1 hrs and 28 minutes and all that hype for nothing. old and  awful taste pizza, old sushi, chewy prime ribs, a lot of dishes are tasteless, most of the dishes are basic, small dessert areas',\n",
       " \"I am writing this for their Sunday Brunch and not their dinner.....MAYYYYYBE I'll give dinner a try next time since other people pics on dinner seem like they have better choices. This is the 3rd time i've been here for lunch/brunch and this is by FAR the most DISSAPOINTING ONE!. Its like they charge you more for being SUNDAY BRUNCH, but they have less food than normal.\\n\\nFirst of all the seafood was so so.....then the chinese section which is usually my favorite didn't have good dishes at all, they even got rid of the roast duck, bbq pork and chinese chicken. That's NOT EVEN AN EXPENSIVE ITEM!!!! Couldn't believe it. \\n\\nThe carving station again was SAD, No lamb chops, NO PRIME RIB, or maybe that prime rib but grossley over cooked. The pork belly was dry. It was just worst than my previous two times and even those times it wasn't FANTASTIC but I would be decently satified, this time I was just FULLY dissapointed. If it wasn't that I'm Total Reward Platinum and didn't have to wait in line I would much rather go to the Bellagio Buffet, at least when I went a month ago their quality of food was ON POINT, less selection but much better quality! I hope they were just having a BAD day and I'll give it another chance because I do like the Bacchanal Buffet, but this past Sunday's exeperience left me LACKLUSTER. PLEASE STOP TAKING AWAY FOOD WHEN YOU MAKE PEOPLE PAY $55 for Sunday Brunch with NO SELECTION OF THE USUAL FOOD ITEMS!!!!\",\n",

Given their reputation, very high price, and yelp reviews, I was hoping for a buffet that stood out from the rest, but the Bacchanal Buffet sure did let me down. \\nThe sushi rolls were the exact same prepackaged rolls at every other buffet on the strip. The desserts were also the same pre-packaged desserts that you find at every other buffet. \\nThe carving table also had nothing different and the tri-tip was tough and chewy.
